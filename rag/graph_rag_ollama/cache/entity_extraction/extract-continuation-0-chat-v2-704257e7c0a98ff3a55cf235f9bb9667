There's a whole interaction effect between the ways in which you visualize an instruction to the user and the kinds of signal you can get back. And that quality of sort of your behavioral alignment to the neural signal is a function of how good you are expressing to the user. And so yeah, we spend a lot of time thinking about the UX, of how we build our applications, of how the decoder actually functions, the control surface as it provides to the user. All these little details matter a lot. So maybe it'd be nice to get into a little bit more detail of what the signal looks like and what the decoding looks like.
