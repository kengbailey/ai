You can actually get better validation metrics, meaning you're fitting the data better and it's generalizing better in offline data, if you use this convolutional architecture. You're reducing parameters, it's sort of a standard standard procedure when you're dealing with time-series data. Now it turns out that when using that model online, the controllability was worse, was far worse, even though the offline metrics were better. And there can be many ways to interpret that, but what that taught me at least was that, hey, it's at least the case right now that if you were to just throw a bunch of compute at this problem and you were trying to sort of high parameter optimize or let some GPT model, or you know, let some GPT or that there's still some inherent modeling gap here.
