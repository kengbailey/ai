Yep. Is that, or is it, is that not an effective way for initial calibration? Yeah, great question. There's a lot to unpack there. So, the first thing I would draw a distinction between a sort of open loop first close loop. So open loop what I mean by that is the user is sort of going from zero to one. They have no model at all and they're trying to get to the place where they have some level of control at all. In that set up you really need to have some task. Then once they have a model, you could imagine them using that model and actually adapting to it and figuring out the right way to use it themselves, and then retraining in that data to give you sort of a boost in performance. There's a lot of challenges associated with both of these techniques, and we can sort of wrap it whole into both loop\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm happy to help you with the problem!
