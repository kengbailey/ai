So what that means is there are set of neurons that would increase their, right, up, down, and any of those vectors. And based on that, you know, you can start to think, well, if you can identify those essential eigenvectors, you can do a lot. And you can actually use that information for actually decoding someone's intended movement from the cortex. So that was a very, very seminal kind of paper that showed that there is some sort of code that you can extract, especially in the mortal cortex. So there's signal there. And if you measure the electrical signal from the the electrical signal from the brain, that you could actually figure out what the intention was. Correct. Yeah, not only electrical signals, but electrical signals from the right set of neurons that give you these preferential direction.
