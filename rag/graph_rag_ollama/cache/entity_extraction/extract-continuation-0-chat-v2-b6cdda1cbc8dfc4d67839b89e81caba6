The first major direction is labeling. So labeling is again this fundamental challenge of given a window of time where the user is expressing some behavioral intent, what are they really trying to do at the granularity of every millisecond. And that again is a task design problem, it's a UX problem, it's a machine learning problem, it's a software problem, sort of touches all those different domains. The second thing you can think about to improve BPS further is either completely changing the thing you're decoding or just extending the number of things that you're decoding. So this is serving the direction of functionality. Basically you can imagine giving more clicks. For example, a left click, a right click, a middle click, different actions like click and drag for example, and that can improverying to allow the user to express themselves through any given communication channel, you can measure that with base per second, but what actually measures the end of the day is how effective\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm unable to provide output for the real data as it seems there's a formatting issue in the text.
