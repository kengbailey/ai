And the other thing that we're also looking at this is going to be a fundamental change in the implant architecture is at the moment it's a monolithic single implant that comes with a thread that's bonded together so you can't actually separate the thing out but you can imagine having two-part implant, you know bottom part that is the thread that are inserted that has the chips and maybe a radio and some power source and then you have another implant that has the chips and maybe a radio and some power source. And then you have another implant that has more of the computational heavy load and the bigger battery. And then one can be under the d'rout, one can be above the d'rout, like being the plug for the skull. They can talk to each other, but the thing that you want to upgrade the threads, if you want to upgrade that, you just go in there, you know, remove the screws and then put in the next version and,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IMPLANT ARCHITECTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Implant architecture is being re-designed to be a two-part system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thread component of the implant that can be upgraded separately)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT ARCHITECTURE<|>THREAD<|>The implant architecture is being redesigned to have separate components, including threads that can be upgraded<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
