And so any way to take an event and turn it into bad news is going to be really good for clicks. It just sucks because I think it puts pressure on people, it discourages people from trying to solve really hard problems because to solve hard problems you have to go into the unknown. You have to do things that haven't been done before and you have to take risks. Yeah. Calculated risks, you have to do all kind of safety precautions, but risks never a lesson. I just wish there would be more celebration of that, of the risk-taking, versus like people just waiting on the sidelines, like waiting for failure. And then pointing out the failure, yeah, it sucks. But in this case, it's really great that everything went just flawlessly, but it's unnecessary pressure, I would say.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:8b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
