Okay, so what's interesting about this geometry? So we'll look at this just geometry of a needle. This is the needle that's engaging with the loops in the thread. So they're the ones that thread the loop and then peel it from the silicon backing and then this is the thing that gets inserted into the tissue and then this pulls out leaving the thread. And this kind of a notch or the shark tooth that we used to call is the thing that actually is grasping the loop and then it's designed in such way such that when you pull out leaves the loop. And the robot is control on this needle. Correct. So this is actually housed in a canula and basically the robot has a lot of the optics that look for where the loop is, there's actually a four or five nanometer light that actually causes the polyimid to fluoresce so that you can locate the location of the loop. So the loop lights up?
