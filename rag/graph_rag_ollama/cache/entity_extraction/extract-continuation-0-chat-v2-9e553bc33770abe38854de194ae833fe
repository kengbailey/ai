So, you know, I ended up there with the idea that maybe I would be a neurologist and study the brain on the side and then discovered that neurology, again I'm gonna make enemies by saying this, but neurology predominantly and distressingly to me is, is the practice of diagnosing a thing and then saying good luck with that when there's not much we can do. And neurosurgery very differently is a it's a powerful lever on taking people that are headed in a bad direction and changing their course in the sense of brain tumors that are potentially treatable or curable with surgery. You know, even aneurysms in the brain, blood vessels that are going to rupture, you can save lives really is at the end of the day what mattered to me. And so I was at USC, as I mentioned, that happens to be one of the great neurosurgery programs.
