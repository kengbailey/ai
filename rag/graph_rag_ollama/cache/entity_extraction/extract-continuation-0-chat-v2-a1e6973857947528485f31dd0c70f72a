And this has evolved over time. So once we gave him the ability to calibrate models on his own, he was able to go and explore various different ways to imagine controlling the cursor. For example he could imagine controlling the cursor by wiling his wrist side to side, or by moving his entire arm, by the key, he tried a whole bunch of stuff to explore the space of what is the most natural way for him to control the cursor that at the same time it's easy for us to decode. Just to clarify, it's through the body mapping procedure that you're able to figure out which finger he can move? Yes, yes, that's one way to do it. Maybe one nuance of the, when he's doing it, he can imagine many more things than we represent in that visual on the screen. So we show him sort of abstractly, here's a cursor.
