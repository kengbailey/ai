One such explanation could be that the context effect difference between some open loop task and some closed-and to to to with Nolan than it is with Monkey. Maybe in this open loop task he's you know watching the Lex Freeman podcast while he's doing the task or he's whistling and listening to music and talking with his friend and ask his mom what's for dinner while he's doing this task.
