As a result of passing that wire blindly into the deep part of the brain. That's not an acceptable safety profile for Neurlink. We start from the position that we want this to be dramatically maybe two or three orders of magnitude safer than that. Safe enough really that you know you or I without a profound medical problem might on our lunch break some day say yeah sure I'll get that. I'd or I without a profound medical problem might on our lunch break someday say yeah sure I'll get that I'd be meaning to upgrade to the latest version and so that the safety constraints given that are high and so we haven't settled on a final solution for arbitrarily approaching deep targets in the brain. It's interesting because you have to avoid blood vessels somehow. You have to, maybe there's creative ways of doing the same thing, like mapping out high-resolution geometry of blood vessels, and then you can go in blind.
