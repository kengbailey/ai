Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

But if you can't even get to another planet, you know, definitely not getting to star systems. And the other possible great filters, super powerful technology like AGI, for example. So you're basically trying to knock out one great filter at a time. Digital Superintelligence is possibly a great filter. I hope it isn't, but it might be. You know, guys like say Jeff Hinton would say, you know, has he invented a number of the key principles in artificial intelligence. I think he's puts the probability of AI annihilation around 10 to 20 percent, something like that. So, you know, so it's not, like, you know, look on the right side, it's a 80 percent likely to be great. So, but I think AI risk mitigation is important. Being a multi-planned species would be a massive risk mitigation. And I do want to sort of, once again, emphasize the importance of having enough children\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:8b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
