And that template consists of sort of how deep the spike, the whole process takes. And if you can see in the signal that that template is matched within certain bounds, then you can say, okay, that's a spike. One reason that approach is super convenient is that you can actually implement that extremely efficiently in hardware, which means that you can run it in a low power across a thousand two-a. Another approach that we've recently started exploring, and this can be combined with the spike detection approach, something called spike bandpower. And the benefits of that approach are that you may be able to pick up some signal from neurons that are maybe too far away to be detected as a spike, because the farther away you are from an electrode, the weaker that actual spike waveform will look like on that electrode\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified:\n\n**##**\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVOLUTIONAL FILTER<|>organization<|>A type of filter used for signal processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPIKE DETECTION APPROACH<|>organization<|>An approach to detecting spikes in signals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPIKE BANDPOWER APPROACH<|>organization<|>An approach to detecting signal from neurons that are too far away)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONVOLUTIONAL FILTER<|>SPIKE DETECTION APPROACH<|>The convolutional filter can be used in the spike detection approach, but it's not a direct relationship.
