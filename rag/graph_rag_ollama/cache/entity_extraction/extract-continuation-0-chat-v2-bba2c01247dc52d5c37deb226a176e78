Identify all entities: For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n   - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n   - entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n   - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes or characteristics\n\n2.

Identify all entities mentioned in the text, including \"Neurlink\", \"you\", \"I\", etc.\n2.
