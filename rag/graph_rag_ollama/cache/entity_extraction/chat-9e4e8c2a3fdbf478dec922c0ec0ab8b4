But yeah in the end you have these membranes with these voltage-gated ion channels that selectively let these charged molecules that are in the extracellular matrix, like in and out. And these neurons generally have these like resting potential where there's a voltage difference between inside the cell and outside the cell. And when there's some sort of stimuli that changes the state such that they need to send information to the downstream network, you know, you start to kind of see these sort of orchestration of these different molecules going in and out of these channels, they also open up, like more of them open up once it reaches some threshold to a point where you have a depolarizing cell that sends an action potential. So it's just a very beautiful kind of orchestration of these these molecules. And what we're trying to do when we place an electrode or parking it next to a neuron is that you're trying to measure these local changes in the potential, again, mediated by the movements\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:8b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
