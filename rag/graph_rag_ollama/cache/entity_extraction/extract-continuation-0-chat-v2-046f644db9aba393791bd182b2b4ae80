So let's take this very specific example. Like maybe your calibration task looks like you're trying the right to be over this target. In that kind of scenario, you could imagine coming up with some sort of consistency metric that you could display to the user of, okay, I know what the spike train looks like on average when you do this action to the right. Maybe I can produce some sort of probabilistic estimate trajectory that you that you imagined and I could give the user some sort of feedback of how consistent are they across different trials. You could also imagine that if the user is prompted with that kind of, the user's prompted with that the user's to thea thea. that maybe the user's engaged to begin with because the task showing something on the screen, even if it's not accurate, it's just because it keeps the user motivated to try to increase that number or push it upwards.
