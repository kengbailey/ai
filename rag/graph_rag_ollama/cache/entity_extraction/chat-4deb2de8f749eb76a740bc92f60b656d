Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

So when you insert these threads like the Utah array it causes neuronal death around the site because you're inserting a foreign object, right? And that kind of elicit these immune response through microglia and astrocytes. They form this protective layer around it. Not only are you killing the neuron cells, but you're also creating this protective layer, that then basically prevents you from recording neural signals because you're getting further and further away from the neurons that you're trying to record. And that that is the biggest mode of failure and in this particular example in that inset it's you know it's about 50 micron with that scale bar the neurons are just seemed to be no trauma. That's such a beautiful image by the way. It's just the, so the browner the neurons, and for some reason I can't look away.
