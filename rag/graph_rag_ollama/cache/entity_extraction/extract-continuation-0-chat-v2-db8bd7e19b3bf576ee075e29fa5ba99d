I don't even know what I'm asking but I'm hoping the intention of my question will land on a profound answer. No, is there some kind of understanding of the laws of UX when it comes to the context of somebody using their brain to control it? Like that's different than actual with a mouse. I think we're in the early stages of discovering those laws, so I wouldn't claim to have solved that problem yet, but there's definitely some things we've learned that make it easier for the user to get stuff done.
