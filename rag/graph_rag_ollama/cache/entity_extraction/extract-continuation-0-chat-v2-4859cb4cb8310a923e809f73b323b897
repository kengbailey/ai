I mean, this is like, we're talking like fractions of human hair. These things are, it's not visible. So, continuing the paragraph, we developed novel hardware and software testing systems, such as our accelerated lifetime teasurass and simulated surgery environment, which is pretty cool. To stress test and validate the robustness of our technologies, we performed many rehearsals of our surgeries to refine our procedures and make them second nature. This is pretty cool. We practice surgeries on proxies with all the hardware and instruments needed in our mock or in engineering space. This helps us rapidly test and measurements. So there's like proxies. Yeah, this proxy is super cool actually.
