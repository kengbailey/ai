You know, we make these thin film arrays in our own microfab. Yeah, there's like you said built in-house, this whole paragraph here from this blog post is pretty gangster. Building the technology is described above has been no small feet and there's a bunch of links here that I recommend people click on. We constructed in-house microfabrication capabilities to rapidly produce various iterations of thin film arrays that constitute our electrode threads. We created a custom femto second laser mill manufacture components with micro level precision. I think there's a tweet associated with this. That's a whole thing that we can get into. Yeah this this okay what are we looking at here? This thing this thing.
