It's like, all right, well, what can I do next? How can I improve my life even a little bit? On a day-to-day basis at first, just trying to find some way to heal as much of my body as possible, to try to get healed, to try to get off a ventilator, learn as much as I could so I could somehow survive once I left the hospital. And then, thank God I had like my family around me. If I didn't have my parents, my siblings, then I would have never made it this far. They've done so much for me. More than I can ever think them for, honestly. And a lot of people don't have that. A lot of people in my situation, their families either aren't capable of providing for them or honestly, just don't want to. And so they get placed somewhere and, you know, in some sort of home. So thankfully, I had my family.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:8b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
