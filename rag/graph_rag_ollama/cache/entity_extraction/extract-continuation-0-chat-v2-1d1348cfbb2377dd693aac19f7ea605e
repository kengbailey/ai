Speech prosthetic is very, very fascinating and there's actually been a lot of really amazing work that's been happening in academia. You know, Sergei Staviski at UC Davis, Jamie Henderson, and, you know, late Krishna Shinoi at Stanford doing just some incredible amount of work in improving speech neuroprosthetics.

And, you know, being vocal articulators and you know being able to like even by mouthing the word or imagine speech you can pick up those signals.
