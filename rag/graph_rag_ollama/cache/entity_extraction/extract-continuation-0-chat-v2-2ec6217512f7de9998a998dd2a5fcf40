Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2.

I'm still holding on to one because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of myself becoming bored with the reality, with the real world where everyone's speaking on one X. Well, depends on the person you can speak very quickly and also if you use a wide range of, if your vocabulary is larger, your bit rate, effective bit rate is higher. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. The effective bit rate. I mean, that is the question is how much information is actually compressed in the low-bit transfer of language. Yeah, if you, if there's a single word that is able to convey something that would normally require, I don't know, 10 simple words, then you've got you know, maybe 10 X compression on your hands.
