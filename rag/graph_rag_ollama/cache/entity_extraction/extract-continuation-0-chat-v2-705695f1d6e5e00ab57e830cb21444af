Let's go. So, maybe before diving into what we do, it's worth understanding what we're trying to measure because that dictates a lot of the requirements for the system that we build. And what we're trying to measure is really individual neurons producing action potentials. An action potential is, you can think of it like a little electrical impulse that you can detect if you're close enough. And by being close enough, I mean like within, let's say a hundred microns of that cell and hundred microns is a very very tiny distance and so the number of neurons that you're going to pick up with any\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm unable to provide an answer in the format requested.
