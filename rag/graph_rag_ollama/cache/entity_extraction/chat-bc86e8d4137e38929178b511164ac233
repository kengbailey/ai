Yeah, so brain is made up of these specialized cells called neurons. There's billions of them, you know, tens of billions. You know, sometimes people grow in a hundred billion that are connected in this complex yet dynamic network that are constantly remodeling. They're changing their synaptic weights. And that's, you know, what we typically call neuroplasticity. And the neurons are also bathed in this, you know, their synaptic weights and that's, you know, what we typically call neuroplasticity. And the neurons are also bathed in this charged environment that is latent with many charge molecules, like potassium ions, sodium ions, chlorine ions, and those actually facilitate these, you know, through ionic current communication between these different networks. And when you look at the, look at a neuron as well, they have these membrane with a beautiful, beautiful protein structure called the voltage selective ion channels, which\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:8b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
