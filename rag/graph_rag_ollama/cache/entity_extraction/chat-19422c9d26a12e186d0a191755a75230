Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2.

I would say that part of what enabled this was just the innovations in the wearable. There's a lot of really, really powerful, tiny, low-power, microcontrollers, temperature sensors, or various different sensors, and power electronics. A lot of innovation really came in, the charging coil design, how this is package, and how do you enable charging charging such that you don't really exceed that temperature limit, which is not a constraint for other devices out there. So let's talk about the threads themselves, those tiny, tiny, tiny things. So how many of them are there? You mentioned a thousand electrodes. How many threads are there? What do the electrodes have to do with the thread? Yeah, so the current instantiation of the device has 64 threads and each thread has 16 electrodes for a total of 1,024 electrodes that are capable of both recording and stimulating. And the thread is basically this polymer insulated wire The metal conductor is the kind\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1:8b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
