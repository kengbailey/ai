So thankfully, I had my family. I have a great group of friends, a great group of buddies from college, who have all rallied around me, and we're all still incredibly close. People always say, you know, if you're lucky, you'll end up with one or two friends from high school that you keep throughout your life. I have about 10, 10 or 12 from high school that have all stuck around and we still get together all of us twice a year. We call it the Spring Series and the fall series. This last one we all did, we dressed up like X-Men, so I did a Professor Xavier, and it was freaking awesome. It was so good. So yeah, I have such a great support system around me, and so, you know, being a quadrilegic isn't that bad. I get weighted on all the time.
