That's what I did, and then I just never came back up. Not sure what happened. I did it running into the water with a couple of guys. And so my idea of what happened is really just that I took like a stray fist, elbow, knee, foot\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BLISS CHAPMAN<|>PERSON<|>Bliss Chapman is a person who had a conversation with Nolan Arbaugh)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN ARBAUGH<|>PERSON<|>Nolan Arbaugh is the first human being to have a neural link device implanted in his brain and was paralyzed in 2016)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLISS CHAPMAN<|>NOLAN ARBAUGH<|>Bliss Chapman had a conversation with Nolan Arbaugh<|>1)\n<|end_header|>\n\nNote: The output only includes entities that are explicitly mentioned in the text, and relationships between them.
