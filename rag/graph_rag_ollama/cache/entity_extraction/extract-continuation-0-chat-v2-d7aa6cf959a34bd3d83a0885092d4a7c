And what's interesting, as I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of physics involved. And the two dominant physics for this electrical recording domain is diffusion physics and electromagnetism. And where one dominates, where Maxwell's equation dominates versus fixed law dominates, depends on where your electrode is. If it's close to the source, mostly electromagnetic based, when you're farther away from it, it's more diffusion-based. So essentially when you're able to park it next to it, you can listen in on those individual chatter and those local changes in the potential, and the type of signal that you get are these canonical textbook neural spiking waveform. When you're, the moment and the type of signal that you get are these canonical textbook neural spiking waveform. When you're the moment you're further away and based on some of the studies that people have done you know Christoph\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm happy to help with the problem!
