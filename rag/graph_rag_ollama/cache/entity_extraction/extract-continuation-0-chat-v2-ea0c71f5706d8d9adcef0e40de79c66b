I actually don't like audio books. I've listened to a ton of them at this point, but I don't really like them. I would much rather like read a physical coffee. So one of the things you would love to be able to experience is opening the book, bringing it up to you and to feel the touch of the paper. Yeah, oh man, the touch, the smell, I mean it's just, like just something about the words on the page and you know they've they've replicated, you know that page color on like the Kindle and stuff. Yeah, it's just not the same. Yeah, so just of a lot of things that I interact within the world, like clothes or literally any physical thing that I interact\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm happy to help with this task!
