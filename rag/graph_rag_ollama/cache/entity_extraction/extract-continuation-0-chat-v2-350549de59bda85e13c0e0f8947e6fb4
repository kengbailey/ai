And body mapping is where you essentially present a visual to the user and you say, hey, imagine doing this. And that visual is a 3D hand opening and closing or our index finger modulating up and down. And you ask the user to imagine that. And obviously you can't see them do move their arm. But while they do this task, you can record neural activity. And you can basically offline model and check, can I predict or can I detect the modulation corresponding with those different actions. And so we did that task and we realized, hey, there's actually some modulation associated with some of his hand motion, which is a first indication that, modulation to do useful things in the world. For example, control on computer cursor. And he started playing with it the first time we showed him it.
