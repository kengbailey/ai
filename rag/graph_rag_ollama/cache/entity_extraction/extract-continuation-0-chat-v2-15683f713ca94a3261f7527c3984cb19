Correct. And robots are not good at that. Currently. I think we're at the dawn of a new era with AI of the parameters for robot responsiveness to be dramatically broadened. Right? I mean, you can't look at a self-driving car and say that it's operating under very narrow parameters, you know, if a chicken runs across the road, it wasn't necessarily programmed to deal with that specifically, but a waymo or self-driving Tesla would have no problem reacting to that appropriately. And so, surgical robots aren't there yet, but give it time. And then there could be a lot of sort of into like semi-autonomous possibilities of maybe a robotic surgeon could say this situation is perfectly familiar or the situation is not familiar.
