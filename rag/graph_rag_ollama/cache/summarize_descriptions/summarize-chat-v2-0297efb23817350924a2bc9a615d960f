{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**NOLAN**\n\nNolan is a patient who underwent surgery for implantation of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system, also known as a Neuralink implant. As one of the first humans to receive this implant, Nolan has gained a nuanced understanding of its impact and capabilities. Specifically, Nolan participated in the first Neuraland clinical trial, which suggests that he is an early adopter and developer of neural interfaces. In fact, Nolan is credited with developing Neuralink, a company that specializes in BCI technology. As a result, Nolan holds the world record for Brain-Physical-Signal (BPS) usage using the device. Additionally, Nolan has shared his experiences with others through online streams, where he discussed issues such as cursor drift when using the N1 implant. Despite any potential drawbacks, such as paying an extra cost for jitteriness when scrolling, Nolan's involvement in Neuralink and his personal experience with BCI technology have made him a knowledgeable and influential figure in this field.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
