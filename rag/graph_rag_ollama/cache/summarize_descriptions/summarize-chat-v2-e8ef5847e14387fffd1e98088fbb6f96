{"result": "The human brain is a complex network of specialized cells called neurons, located in the head where thin-filum arrays were inserted. It is an organ in which neurons and electrical currents play a role, containing the cerebellum as part of its structure. The brain has a complex structure made up of neurons, glial cells, and other tissues, and it is the location where users' brain activity is recorded during body mapping and used to control a computer cursor. It is an infinitely powerful machine that has intelligence and cognition arising from it, and it is part of the body that contains the brain and nervous system.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
