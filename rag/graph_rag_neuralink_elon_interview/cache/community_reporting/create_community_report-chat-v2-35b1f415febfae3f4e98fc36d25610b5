community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below.
