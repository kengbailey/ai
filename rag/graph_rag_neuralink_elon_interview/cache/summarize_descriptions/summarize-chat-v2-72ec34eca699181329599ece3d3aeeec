{"result": "The Utah Array is a neural interface device developed by Richard Norman in 1997. It features rigid silicon shanks with exposed recording sites at the end. As a type of brain implant, the Utah Array has been used for decades. However, its rigid electrodes can cause neuronal death and trigger immune responses when inserted into brain tissue, which often leads to device failure over time.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
