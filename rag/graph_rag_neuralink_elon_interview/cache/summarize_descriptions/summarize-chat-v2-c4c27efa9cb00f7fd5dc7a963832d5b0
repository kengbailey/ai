{"result": "Calibration is a crucial process in the use of Neuralink's system, involving several key steps to ensure accurate mapping of brain data to computer commands. It is a daily task where users engage in activities such as imagining different actions and following a cursor on the screen to train the algorithm. This process, conducted through the Link app, translates brain activity into cursor control. Calibration involves adjusting the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to improve its performance, which can take between 7 to 45 minutes. The goal is to accurately map neural spikes to user intentions, requiring precision and continued adjustments to maintain optimal functionality.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
