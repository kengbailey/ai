{"result": "BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) is a technology that allows for direct communication between the brain and external devices. This technology enables users to control devices using brain signals, making it particularly useful for assisting individuals with disabilities. BCI is also a field in academia focused on developing neural devices and control systems, and it includes a set of tools designed to study the underlying mechanisms of the brain. The primary goal of BCI technology is to facilitate new forms of human-machine interaction by leveraging brain signals to operate various external devices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
