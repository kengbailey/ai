{"result": "An action potential is a rapid rise and subsequent fall in voltage or membrane potential across a cellular membrane, which is a key part of neuron communication. It is an electrical impulse produced by neurons and serves as a crucial signal measured by neural implants. This electrical impulse is fundamental to the way neurons communicate with each other.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
