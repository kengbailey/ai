{"result": "The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, responsible for thought, memory, emotion, sensory processing, and decision-making. It is the organ where Neuralink's implant and electrodes are placed to record neural signals and test neural devices. The human brain is also used as an analogy to describe the complexity and cabling of supercomputer centers. In the context of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) experiments, the human brain is noted to be 10 times the size of a monkey or sheep brain and more dynamic in movement.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
