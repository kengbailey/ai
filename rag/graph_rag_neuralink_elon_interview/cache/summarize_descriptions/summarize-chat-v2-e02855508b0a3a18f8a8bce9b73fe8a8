{"result": "Bluetooth is a wireless communication protocol and technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances. It is employed in various applications, including data transmission in devices. Specifically, in the context of Neuralink, Bluetooth is used to transmit neural data from the implant to external devices. However, it is noted that Bluetooth's short-range data exchange capability can be a bottleneck in Neuralink's communication protocol.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
