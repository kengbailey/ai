{"result": "SPIKE BANDPOWER is a method used to analyze the power of neural spikes. It is also employed to detect neural signals from neurons that are too far away to be detected as individual spikes. This technique provides a means to study neural activity by focusing on the power of the signals, even when the neurons are not in close proximity.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
