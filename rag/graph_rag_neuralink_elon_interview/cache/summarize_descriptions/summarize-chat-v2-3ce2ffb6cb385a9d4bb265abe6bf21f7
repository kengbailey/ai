{"result": "THREADS are the components of the neural device developed by Neuralink that are inserted into the brain to record neural signals. These tiny wires, also referred to as threads, are part of the implant and contain chips and power sources. Their primary function is to capture and transmit neural signals, facilitating the interface between the brain and external devices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
