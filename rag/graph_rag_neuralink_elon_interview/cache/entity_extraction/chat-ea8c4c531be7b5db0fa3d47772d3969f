And I think that as much of, like the darkness and the evil that's in the world, it makes us all appreciate the good and the  that's in the world, it makes us all appreciate the good and the things we have so much more. And I think, you know, like when I had my accident, the first, one of the first things I said to one of my best friends was, and this was within like the first month or two after my accident, I said, you know, everything about this accident has just made me understand and believe that like God is real and that there really is a God basically and that like my interactions with him have all been you know real and worthwhile and he said if anything seeing me go through this accident he believes that there isn't a god and it's a very different reaction but I believe that it is it is a way for God to test us, to build our character, to send us through trials and tribulations to make sure that we understand how precious he is and the things that he's given us and the time that he's given us and then to hopefully grow from all of that. I think that's a huge part of being here is to not just, you know, have an easy life and do everything that's easy, but to step out of our comfort zones and really challenge ourselves because I think that's how we grow. What gives you hope about this whole thing we have going on, human civilization? Oh man. I think people are my biggest inspiration. Even just being at Neurlink for a few months, looking people in the eyes and hearing their motivations for why they're doing this. It's so inspiring. And I know that they could be other places at cushy or jobs, working somewhere else, doing X, Y, or Z, that doesn't really mean that much. But instead, they're here, and they want to better humanity, and they want to better just the people around them, the people that have interacted with in their life, they want to make better lives for their own family members who might have disabilities, or they look at someone like me and they say, you know, I can do something about that so I'm going to. And it's always been what I've connected with most in the world are people. I've always the the and I love learning about people, and I love learning like how people developed and where they came from and to see how much people are willing to do for someone like me when they don't have to, and they're going out of their way to make my life better. It gives me a lot of hope for just humanity in general, how much we care and how much we're capable of when we all kind of get together and try to make a difference. And I know there's a lot of bad out there in the world, but there always has been and there always will be. And I think that that is, it shows human resiliency and it shows what we're able, what we're able to endure and how much, how much we just want to be there and help each other and how much satisfaction we get from that, because I think that's one of the reasons that we're here is just to help each other. And, um, I don't know, that, that always gives me hope is just realizing that we're here is just to help each other. And I don't know, that always gives me hope. It's just realizing that there are people out there who still care and who want to help. And thank you for being one such human being and continuing to be a great human being through everything you've been through and being an inspiration to many people, to myself for many reasons including your epic unbelievably great performance on webgrid I will be training all night tonight to try and to try to catch up you can do it and I believe in you that you can once you come back so sorry to interrupt with the Austin trip once you come back eventually beat bliss yeah yeah yeah for sure absolutely I'm rooting for you the the whole world is rooting for you. Thank you for everything you've done, man. Thanks, thanks, man. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nolan Arbaugh, and before that, with Elon Musk, D.J. Saw, Matthew McDougal, and Bliss Chapman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Aldous Huxley in the doors of perception. We live together. We act on and react to one another. But always, and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena. they are crucified alone. Embrace, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence in vain. But its very nature, every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy its solitude. Sensations, feelings, inside its fancies, all these are private, and except through symbols and a second hand incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation every human group is a society of island universes. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
