Like, for people who have essentially complete or near complete loss of from the brain to the body, like Stephen Hawking would be an example, the neural links would be incredibly profound because I mean you can imagine if Stephen Halking could communicate as fast as we're communicating, perhaps faster. And that's certainly possible, probable in fact, likely, I'd say. So there's a kind of dual track of medical and non-medical, meaning, so everything you've talked about could be applied to people who are non-disabled in the future? The logical thing to do is, sensible thing to do, is to start off solving basic neuron damage issues. Yes. Because the there's obviously some risk with with a new device is you can't get the risk at zero. It's not possible. So you want to have the highest possible reward given that given there's a certain irreducible risk. And if somebody's able to have a profound improvement in their communication, that's worth the risk. As you get the risk down. Yeah, as you get the risk down, once the risk is down to, you know, if you have like thousands of people that have been using it for per years and the risk is minimal, then perhaps at that point you could consider saying, okay, let's aim for augmentation. Now I think we're actually going to aim for augmentation with people who have neuron damage. So we're not just aiming to get people a communication data rate equivalent to normal humans. We're aiming to give people who have, you know, a quarter-plegic or maybe have complete loss of the connection to the brain and body, a communication data rate that exceeds normal humans. Well, we're in there, why not? Let's give people superpowers. And the same for vision. As you restore vision, that could be aspects of that restoration that are superhuman. Yeah, at first the vision restoration will be Lores. Because you have to say like how many neurons can you put in there and trigger and you can do things where you adjust the electric field to like even if you've got, say, 10,000 neurons. It's not just 10,000 pixels, because you can adjust the field between the neurons and do them in patterns in order to get, have say 10,000 electrodes effectively give you, I don't know, maybe like having a mega pixel or a 10 megapixel situation. So, and then over time, I think you get to higher resolution than human eyes, and you could also see in different wavelengths. So like Jordi LaFlege from Star Trek. You know, I'd like the thing. You could just, do you want to see in radar? No problem. You can see ultraviolet, infrared, eagle vision, whatever you want. Do you think there will be, let me ask a Joe Rogan question. Do you think that'll be, I just recently taken ayahuasca. Is that a question? No, well, yes. Well, I guess technically it is. Yeah, have you try it. Ever tried to see it? Do you have to try? I love you, Joe. Okay. Yeah, wait, have you said much about it? I have not. I have not. I've not. Okay, well, well, I've spilled beans. It was a truly incredible today. Wow. Yeah, I mean, you're in the jungle. Yeah, amongst the trees, myself, and the shaman. Yeah, yeah, yeah, with the insects, with the animals all around you, like jungle as far as I can see, there's no- I mean- That's the way to do it. Things are gonna look pretty wild. Yeah, pretty wild. I think a extremely high dose. Just don't go hugging an anacondo or something, you know? You haven't lived unless you made love to an anaconda. I'm sorry. But. Snakes and ladders. Yeah, I took extremely high dose of nine cups. Yeah. Okay. Okay. that sounds like a lot. Is it normal's one cup or two? One or two. Yeah. Sounds like a lot. Like what's it all? Is it one's one cup or one or two? I usually one. Yeah. Wait. Like right off the bat or do you work the way after it? So I, uh, across two days because in the first day I took two and I, okay. It was a ride but it wasn't like a revelation. It wasn't into deep space type. It was just like a little little little little a little airplane a little airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane a little little a little little a little airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane airplane a little a little a little a little little a little little a little space type ride. It was just like a little airplane ride. I saw some trees and some some visuals and all that. I just saw a dragon all that kind of stuff. But uh... At nine cups, you went to Pluto, I think. Pluto, yeah. No, deep space. Deep space. No, one of the interesting aspects of my experience is I was, I thought I would have some demons, some stuff to work through. I had, that's what everyone says. That's what everyone says, yeah, I had nothing. I had all positive. I just so full, I don't think so. I don't know. But I kept, I kept thinking about, it had like extremely high resolution, okay. It was just, and it's just, not from my relationship with that person, but just as the person themselves, I had just this deep gratitude of who they are\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
