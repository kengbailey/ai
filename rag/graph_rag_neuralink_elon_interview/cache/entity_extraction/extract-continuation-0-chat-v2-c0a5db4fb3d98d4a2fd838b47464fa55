I'm still holding on to one because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of myself becoming bored with the reality, with the real world where everyone's speaking on one X. Well, depends on the person you can speak very quickly and also if you use a wide range of, if your vocabulary is larger, your bit rate, effective bit rate is higher. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. The effective bit rate. I mean, that is the question is how much information is actually compressed in the low-bit transfer of language. Yeah, if you, if there's a single word that is able to convey something that would normally require, I don't know, 10 simple words, then you've got you know, maybe 10 X compression on your hands. And that's really like with memes, memes are like data compression. It can evades a whole, there's, you're simultaneously hit with a wide range of symbols that you can interpret, and it's, you kind of get it faster than if it were words or a simple picture. And of course you're referring to memes broadly like ideas. Yeah there's a an entire idea structure that is like an idea template and then you can add something to that idea template, but somebody has that pre-existing idea template in their head. So when you add that incremental bit of information, you're conveying much more than if you just set a few words. It's everything associated with that meme. You think there'll be emergent leaps of capability as you scale the number of electrodes? Yeah. Do you think there'll be like an actual number where it just, the human experience will be altered? Yes. What do you think that number might be, whether electrodes or BPS? We of course don't know for sure, but is this 10,000, 100,000? Yeah, I mean, certainly if you're anywhere at 10,000 plus per second, I mean, that's vastly faster than any human can communicate right now. If you think the what is the average bus per second of a human it is less than one bit per second over the course of a day because there are 86,400 seconds in a day and you don't communicate 86,400 tokens in a day. Therefore your per second is less than one, averaged over 24 hours. It's quite slow. And now even if you're communicating very quickly and you're, you know, you're talking to somebody who understands what you're saying, because in order to communicate, you have to, at least to some degree, model the mind state of the person to whom you're speaking, then take the concept you're trying to convey, compress that into a small number of syllables, speak them and hope that the concept you're trying to convey, compress that into a small number of syllables, speak them, and hope that the other person decompress them into a conceptual structure that is as close to what you have in your mind as possible. Yeah, I mean there's a lot of single loss there in that process. Yeah, very lossy compression and decompression. And a lot of the, a lot of what your neurons are doing is distilling the concepts down to a small number of symbols of, say, syllables that I'm speaking, or keystrokes, whatever the case may be. So, that's a lot of what your brain computation is doing. Now there is an argument that that's actually a healthy thing to do or a helpful thing to do because as you try to compress complex concepts you're perhaps forced to distill the you know what is most essential in those concepts as opposed to just all the fluff. So in the process of compression, you distill things down to what matters the most because you can only say a few things. So that is perhaps helpful. I think we might probably get if our data rate increases, it's highly probable that will become far more verbose. Just like your computer, you know, when computers had like my first computer had 8K of RAM, you know, so you really thought about every bite and you know now you got computers with many gigabytes of RAM. So you know if you want to do an iPhone app that just says hello world it's probably, I don't know, several megabytes minimum, a bunch of fluff, but nonetheless we still prefer to have the computer with more memory and more compute. So the long-term aspiration of Neuralink is to improve the AI human symbiosis by increasing the bad width of the communication. Because if, even if in the most benign scenario of AI you have to consider that the AI is simply going to get bored waiting for you to spit out a few words, I mean if the AI can communicate it terra bits per second and you're communicating it you know bits per second, it's like told me to a tree. Well it is a very interesting question for a super intelligent species. What use are humans? I think there is some argument for humans as a source of will. Will. Well yeah, source of will of purpose. So if you consider the human mind as being essentially, there's the primitive limbic elements, which basically even like reptiles have, and there's the cortex, the thinking and planning part of the brain. Now the cortex is much smarter than the limbic system, and yet is largely in service to the limbic system, it's trying to make the limbic system happy. I mean, the cortex is much smarter than the Olympic system and yet is largely in service to the Olympic system. It's trying to make the Olympic system happy. I mean the sheer amount of compute that's gone into people trying to get laid is insane.
