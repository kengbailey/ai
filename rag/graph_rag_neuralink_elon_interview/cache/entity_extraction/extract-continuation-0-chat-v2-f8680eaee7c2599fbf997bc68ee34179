So we can ID that part of the brain in anyone who's preparing to enter our trial and say, okay, that part of the brain, we confirm is your hand in tension area. And so I'll make a little cut in the skin. We'll flap the skin open, just like kind of opening the hood of a car, only a lot smaller. Make a perfectly round, one inch diameter hole in the skull. Remove that bit of skull, open the lining of the brain, the covering of the brain, it's like a little bag of water that the brain floats in, and then show that part of the brain to our robot. And then this is where the robot shines, it can come in and take these tiny, you know, much smaller than human hair, electrodes and precisely insert them into the cortex, into the surface of the brain, to a very precise depth in a very precise spot that avoids all the blood vessels that are coating the surface of the brain. And after the robot's done with its part, then, you know, the human comes back in and puts the implant into that hole in the skull and covers it up, screwing it down to the skull and sewing the skin back together. So the whole thing is, you know, a few hours long, it's extremely low risk compared to the average neurosurgery involving the brain that that might say open up a deep part of the brain or manipulate blood vessels in the brain. This this opening on the surface of the brain with with only cortical micro-insertions carries significantly less risk than a a lot the tumor or aneurysm surgeries that are routinely done. So cortical micro-insurtions that are via robot and computer vision are designed to avoid the blood vessels. Exactly. So I know you're a bit biased here, but let's compare human and machine. So what are human surgeons able to do well and what are robot surgeons able to do well? At this stage of our human civilization development? Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. Humans are general purpose machines. We're able to adapt to unusual situations. We're able to change the plan on the fly. I remember well a surgery that I was doing many years ago, down in San Diego, where the plan was to open a small hole behind the ear and go reposition a blood vessel that had come to lay on the facial nerve, the trigeminal nerve, the nerve that goes to the face. When that blood vessel lays on the nerve, it can cause just intolerable, horrific shooting pain that people describe like being zapped with a cattle prod. And so the beautiful elegant surgery is to go move this blood vessel off the nerve. The surgery team, we went in there and started moving this blood vessel and then found that there was a giant aneurysm on that blood vessel that was not easily visible on the preop scans. And so the plan had to dynamically change and that the human surgeons had no problem with that. We're trained for all those things. Robots wouldn't do so well in that situation, at least in their current incarnation, fully robotic surgery, like, you know, the electrode insertion portion of the neuralink surgery, it goes according to a set plan. And so the humans can interrupt the flow and change the plan, but the robot can't really change the plan midway through. It operates according to how it was programmed and how it was asked to run. It does its job very precisely, but not with a wide degree of latitude and how to react to changing conditions. So there could be just a very large number of ways that you could be surprised as a surgeon. When you enter a situation that could be subtle things that you have to dynamically adjust to. Correct. And robots are not good at that. Currently. I think we're at the dawn of a new era with AI of the parameters for robot responsiveness to be dramatically broadened. Right? I mean, you can't look at a self-driving car and say that it's operating under very narrow parameters, you know, if a chicken runs across the road, it wasn't necessarily programmed to deal with that specifically, but a waymo or self-driving Tesla would have no problem reacting to that appropriately. And so, surgical robots aren't there yet, but give it time. And then there could be a lot of sort of into like semi-autonomous possibilities of maybe a robotic surgeon could say this situation is perfectly familiar or the situation is not familiar. And in the not familiar case a human could take over. But basically like be very conservative and saying, okay, this for sure has no issues, no surprises, and the humans deal with the surprises with the edge cases all that. Yeah. That's one possibility. So like you think eventually you be out of the job. What you being neurosurgeon, your job being neurosurgeon. Humans there will not be many neurosurgeons left on this earth. I'm not worried about my job in the course of my professional life. I think I would tell my kids not necessarily to go in this line of work, depending on how things look in 20 years. It's so fascinating because I, I mean, I, if if I have a line of work I would say it's programming and if you ask me like for the last I don't know 20 years what I would recommend for people if I would tell them yeah go, go there's just you will always have a job if you're a programmer because there's more and more computers and all this kind of stuff and it pays well. But then you realize these large language models come along and they're really damn good at generating code. So it's overnight you could be surprised like wow what is the contribution of the human really. But then you start to think okay it does seem that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAN DIEGO<|>GEO<|>San Diego is a city where a surgery was performed involving repositioning a blood vessel that had come to lay on the facial nerve)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a company involved in developing brain-machine interfaces, including surgeries involving electrode insertion into the brain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAYMO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Waymo is a company that develops self-driving cars capable of reacting to unexpected situations on the road)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a company that develops self-driving cars capable of reacting to unexpected situations on the road)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIGEMINAL NERVE<|>GEO<|>The trigeminal nerve is a nerve that goes to the face and can cause severe pain if a blood vessel lays on it)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACIAL NERVE<|>GEO<|>The facial nerve is a nerve that can be affected by blood vessels, causing severe pain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORTICAL MICRO-INSERTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Cortical micro-insertions are a type of neurosurgery involving the precise insertion of electrodes into the brain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI refers to artificial intelligence, which is expected to broaden the parameters for robot responsiveness in surgeries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRODE INSERTION<|>EVENT<|>Electrode insertion is a part of the Neuralink surgery where electrodes are precisely inserted into the brain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOOD VESSEL<|>GEO<|>Blood vessels are part of the circulatory system and can cause complications during neurosurgery if not properly managed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANEURYSM<|>EVENT<|>An aneurysm is a condition where a blood vessel bulges and can cause complications during surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-DRIVING CAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Self-driving cars, such as those developed by Waymo and Tesla, are capable of reacting to unexpected situations on the road)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURGICAL ROBOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Surgical robots are machines used in surgeries to perform precise tasks, such as electrode insertion in Neuralink surgeries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN SURGEON<|>PERSON<|>Human surgeons are medical professionals capable of adapting to unexpected situations during surgery)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ELECTRODE INSERTION<|>Neuralink is involved in surgeries that include electrode insertion into the brain<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAYMO<|>SELF-DRIVING CAR<|>Waymo develops self-driving cars capable of reacting to unexpected situations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>SELF-DRIVING CAR<|>Tesla develops self-driving cars capable of reacting to unexpected situations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN DIEGO<|>TRIGEMINAL NERVE<|>A surgery was performed in San Diego involving the trigeminal nerve<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAN DIEGO<|>FACIAL NERVE<|>A surgery was performed in San Diego involving the facial nerve<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIGEMINAL NERVE<|>FACIAL NERVE<|>Both the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve can cause severe pain if affected by blood vessels<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORTICAL MICRO-INSERTIONS<|>ELECTRODE INSERTION<|>Cortical micro-insertions involve the precise insertion of electrodes into the brain<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI<|>SURGICAL ROBOT<|>AI is expected to broaden the parameters for robot responsiveness in surgeries<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLOOD VESSEL<|>ANEURYSM<|>An aneurysm is a condition involving a blood vessel that can cause complications during surgery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN SURGEON<|>SURGICAL ROBOT<|>Human surgeons can adapt to unexpected situations, whereas surgical robots follow a set plan<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
