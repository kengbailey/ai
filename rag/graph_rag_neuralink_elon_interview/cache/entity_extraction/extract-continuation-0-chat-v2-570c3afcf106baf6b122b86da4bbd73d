So if you go to the next image, this is also kind of illustrates the second point because you can make an argument and initially when we saw the previous image, we said, oh, like, are the threats just floating? Like, what we actually looking at the right thing? So what we did is, we did another stain, and this is all done in-house, of this mason's trichrome stain, which is in blue that shows these collagen layers. So the blue basically, you don't want the blue around the implant threads, because that means that there's some sort of scarring  happen. And what you're seeing, if you look at individual threads, is that you don't see any of the blue. Which means that there has been absolutely, or very, very minimal to a point where it's not detectable amount of trauma in these inserted threads. So that presumably is one of the big benefits of having this kind of flexible thread that's... Yeah, so we think this is primarily due to the size as well as the flexibility of the threads. Also the fact that R1 is avoiding that scuture, so we're not disrupting or we're not causing damage to the vessels and not breaking any of the blood brain barrier has, you know, basically caused the immune response to be muted. But this is also a nice illustration of the immune response to be muted. But this is also a nice illustration of the size of things. So this is the tip of the thread. Yeah, those are neurons. And they're neurons. And this is the thread listening. And the electrodes are positioned how? Yeah, so this is, what you're looking at is not electro themselves. Those are the conductive wires, so each of those should probably be two micron in width. So what we're looking at is we're looking at the coronal slice. So we're looking at some slice of the tissue. So as you go deeper, you know, you'll obviously have less and less of the tapering of the thread. But yeah, the point basically being that there's just kind of cells around the insert a site, which is just an incredible thing to see. I've just never seen anything like this. How easy and safe is it to remove the implant? So it depends on when. In the first three months or so after the surgery, there's a lot of kind of tissue modeling that's happening. You know, similar to when you got a cut, you know, you obviously start over first couple weeks, or depending on the size of the wound, scar tissue forming, right? There are these like contracted, and then in the end they turn it to scab and you can scp it off. The same thing happens in the brain and it's a very dynamic environment and before the scar tissue or the new membrane or the new membrane that forms it's quite easy to just pull during that. Once the scar tissue forms, and with Nolan as well, we believe that that's the thing that's currently anchoring the threads, so we haven't seen any more movements since then, so they're quite stable. It gets harder to actually completely extract the thread. So our current method for removing the device is cutting the thread, leaving the tissue intact, and then unscrewing and taking the implant up. And that hole is now going to be plugged with either another neural link or just with a, you know, a pique-based, you know, plastic-based cap. Is it okay to leave the threads in there forever? Yeah, we think so. We've done studies where, you know, we left them there. And one of the biggest concerns that we had is like, do they migrate? And do they get to a point where they should not be, we haventhe scar tissue forms, they get anchored in place. And I should also say that, you know, when we say upgrades, like, it's not, we're not just talking in theory here, like we've actually upgraded many, many times. Most of our monkeys, or non-human primates, NHP, have been upgraded, you know, Pageard, who you saw playing mind pong, has the latest version of the device since two years ago and is seemingly very happy and healthy and fat. So what's designed for the future, the upgrade procedure? So maybe for Nolan. What would the upgrade look like? It was essentially what you're mentioning, is there a way to upgrade, sort of the upgrade look like? It was essentially what you're mentioning. Is there a way to upgrade the device internally? Where you take it apart and sort of keep the capsule and upgrade the internals? Yeah, so there are a couple of different things here. So for Nolan, if we work to upgrade, what we would have to do is either cut the threads or extract the threads, depending on kind of the situation there, in terms of how they're anchored or scarred in. If you were to remove them with the tural substitute, you have an intact brain, so you can re-insert different threads with the updated implant package. There are a couple different other ways that we're thinking about the future of what the upgradable system looks like. One is, you know, at the moment we currently remove the Dura, this kind of thick layer that protects the brain, but that actually is a thing that actually proliferates the scar tissue formation. So typically the general good rule of thumb is you want to leave the nature as is and not disrupt it as much. the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the scar tissue formation. So typically, the general good rule of thumb is you want to leave the nature as is and not disrupt it\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NU-N<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NU-N is mentioned in the context of a discussion about implant threads and their effects on tissue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>G-FAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>G-FAP is mentioned in the context of a discussion about implant threads and their effects on tissue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R1 is mentioned as avoiding scuture and not causing damage to vessels or breaking the blood-brain barrier, leading to a muted immune response)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>Nolan is mentioned in the context of discussing the anchoring of threads and the upgrade procedure for implants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGEARD<|>PERSON<|>Pageard is a non-human primate who has been upgraded with the latest version of the device and is seemingly very happy and healthy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIND PONG<|>EVENT<|>Mind Pong is an event where Pageard, a non-human primate, was seen playing a game using the implant device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NHP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NHP stands for non-human primates, which are subjects in the implant upgrade studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is mentioned as a potential replacement for the implant device or as a cap for the hole left by the removed implant)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>R1<|>Nolan is involved in the discussion about the anchoring of threads and the upgrade procedure for the R1 implant<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAGEARD<|>NHP<|>Pageard is a non-human primate (NHP) who has been upgraded with the latest version of the implant device<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAGEARD<|>MIND PONG<|>Pageard was seen playing Mind Pong using the implant device<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>R1<|>Neuralink is mentioned as a potential replacement or cap for the R1 implant device<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
