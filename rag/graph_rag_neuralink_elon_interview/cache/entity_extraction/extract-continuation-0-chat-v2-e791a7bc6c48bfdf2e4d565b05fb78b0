And I would love that because I would like to know if what I'm doing is going well or not, but then I've also told me like, yeah, not necessarily like one to one. It doesn't actually mean that calibration is going well in some ways, so it's not like 100% and they don't want to like skew what I'm experiencing or want me to change things based on that if that number isn't always accurate to like how the model will turn out or how like the end result. That's at least what I got from it. One thing I do, I have asked them in something that I really enjoy striving for is towards the end of calibration, there is like a time between targets. And so I like to keep like at the end, that number as low as possible. So at the beginning it can be four, it below like 1.5 or if I could get it to like one second between like bubbles because in my mind that translates really nicely to something like web grid where I know if I can hit a target one every second that I'm doing real real well. There you go that's a way to get a score on the calibrations like like the speed are quickly getting from bubble to bubble. Yeah. So there's the open loop, and then it goes to the closed loop. Close loop, can I already start giving you a sense because you're getting feedback of like how good the model is? Yeah, so closed loop is when I first get cursor control and how they've described it to me, someone who does not understand this stuff. I am the dumbest person in the room every time I'm with any of these guys Humility. Yeah Is that I am closing the loop so I am actually now The one that is like finishing the loop of? Whatever this loop is. I don't even know what the loop is. They've never told me they just say there is a loop and at one point it's open and I can't control and then I get control and it's closed. So I'm finishing the loop. So how long the calibration usually takes? You said like 10-15 minutes? Well yeah, they're they're trying to get that number down pretty low. That's what we've been working on a lot recently is getting that down as low as possible so that way, you know, if this is something that people need to do on a daily basis, or if some people need to do on a, like, every other day basis or once a week, they don't want people to be sitting in calibration for long periods of time, I think they've wanted to get it down seven minutes or below, at least where we're at right now, it'd be nice if they, you never had to do calibration. So we'll get there at some point, I'm sure, the more we learn about the brain. Like I think that's the dream. I think right now, for me to get like really, really good models, I'm in calibration 40 or 45 minutes. And I don't mind, like I said, they always feel really bad. But if it's going to get me a model that can like break these records on WebGrid? And what does it take to be a world-class performer in Web Grid as you continue to break world records? Yeah. Um, It's like a gold medalist talk. Well, yeah, you know, I'd like to think, I'd like to think everyone who's helped me get here, my coaches, my parents, for driving me to practice every day at five in the morning like to thank God and just overall my dedication to my craft. The interviews with athletes are always like that exact. It's like that template. Yeah so so so web grid is a grid. It's literally just a grid. They can make it as big or small as you can make a grid. A single box on that grid will light up and you go and click it. And it is a way for them to benchmark how good a BCI is. So it's, you know, pretty straightforward. You just click targets. Only one blue cell appears and you're supposed to move the mouse to there and click on it. So I like playing on like bigger grids because it, the bigger the grid, the more BPS, it's bits per second that you get every time you click one. So I'll say I'll play on like a 35 by 35 grid. And then one of those little squares, a cell, call it, target, whatever, will light up and you move the cursor there and you click it and then you do that forever. And you've been able to achieve at first eight bits per second and you recently broke that. Yeah, I'm at 8.5 right now. I would have beaten that literally the day before I came to Austin But I had like a I don't know like a five-second lag right at the end And I just had to wait until the latency calm down and then I kept clicking but I was at like 8.01 and then five seconds of lag and then the next like three targets I clicked all stayed at 8.01 so if I would have been able to click during that time of lag I probably would have hit I don't know I might have hit nine so I'm there I'm like I'm really close and then this whole Austin trip has really gotten in the way of my web grid playing ability. Yeah, so that's all you're thinking about right now. Yeah, I know. I just I just want, I want to do better. At nine. I want\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WEB GRID<|>EVENT<|>Web Grid is a benchmarking activity for BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) performance where participants click on targets in a grid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTIN<|>GEO<|>Austin is a city that the speaker visited, which interrupted their Web Grid practice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BCI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BCI stands for Brain-Computer Interface, a technology used to control devices with brain signals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIBRATION<|>EVENT<|>Calibration is the process of adjusting the BCI to improve its performance, which can take between 7 to 45 minutes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BPS<|>EVENT<|>BPS stands for bits per second, a measure of performance in the Web Grid activity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURSOR CONTROL<|>EVENT<|>Cursor control is the phase in the BCI process where the user gains control over the cursor, closing the loop)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPEN LOOP<|>EVENT<|>Open loop is the initial phase in the BCI process where the user does not have control over the cursor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOSED LOOP<|>EVENT<|>Closed loop is the phase in the BCI process where the user gains control over the cursor, completing the loop)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEB GRID<|>BCI<|>Web Grid is used to benchmark the performance of BCI<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIBRATION<|>BCI<|>Calibration is a process to improve BCI performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURSOR CONTROL<|>BCI<|>Cursor control is a phase in the BCI process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPEN LOOP<|>BCI<|>Open loop is the initial phase in the BCI process<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOSED LOOP<|>BCI<|>Closed loop is the phase where the user gains control over the cursor in the BCI process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BPS<|>WEB GRID<|>BPS is a measure of performance in the Web Grid activity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTIN<|>WEB GRID<|>The speaker's visit to Austin interrupted their Web Grid practice<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
