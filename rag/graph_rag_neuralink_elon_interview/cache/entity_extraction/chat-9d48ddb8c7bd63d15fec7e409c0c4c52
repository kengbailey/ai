It's that's that's that's that's that's to sex is justified. In fact, we should probably increase it. Well, I mean, there's this hedonistic sex, which is, you know, that's near the hittle there. It's not productive. It doesn't produce kids. Well, you know, you, what matters, I mean, Durant makes this very clear, because's looked at one civilization after another and they all went through the same cycle. When the civilization was under stress, the birth rate was high. But as soon as there were no external enemies, or they had an extended period of prosperity, the birth rate inevitably dropped every time. I don't believe there's a single exception. So that's like the foundation of it. You need to have people. Yeah. I mean it's at base level, no humans, no humanity. And then there is other things like, you know, human freedoms and just giving people the freedom to build stuff. Yeah, absolutely. But at a basic level, if you do not at least maintain your numbers, if you're below replacement rate and that trend continues, you will eventually disappear. It's just elementary. Now, then obviously, we'll also want to try to avoid like massive wars. You know, if there's a global thermonuclear war, probably we're rolled toast, you know, radioactive toast. So we want to try to avoid those things. Then there are, there's a thing that happens over time with with any given civilization which is thing that happens over time with any given civilization which is that the laws and regulations accumulate. And if there's not, if there's not some forcing function like a war to clean up the accumulation of laws and regulations, eventually everything becomes legal. And you, that's like the hardening of the arteries. Or a way to think of it is like being tied down by a million little strings like gullibur. You can't move. And it's not like any one of those strings is the issue, which you've got a million of them. So, it has to be a sort of a garbage collection for laws and regulations so that you don't keep accumulating laws and regulations to the point where you can't do anything. This is why we can't build a high-speed rail in America. It's illegal. It's illegal six weeks to Sunday to build high street rail in America. I wish you could just like for a week going to Washington and like be the head of the committee for making, what is it, for the garbage collection, making government smaller, like for removing stuff. I have discussed with Trump the idea of a government efficiency commission. Nice, yeah. And I would be willing to be part of that commission. Nice. Yeah. And I would be willing to be part of that commission. I wonder how hard that is. The antibody reaction will be very strong. Yeah. So you really have to, you're attacking the matrix at that point. Matrix will fight back. How are you doing with that? Being attacked? Me? Attack? Yeah. There's a lot of it. Yeah, there is a lot. I mean, every day another tie-up, you know. How do you keep your just positivity? How do you optimism about the world a clarity of thinking about the world? So just not become resentful or cynical or all that kind of stuff? Just getting attacked by you know a very large number of people misrepresented. Oh yeah, that's like a daily occurrence. Yes. So I mean it does get me down at times. I mean, it makes me sad, but... I mean, at some point you have to sort of say, look, the attacks are by people that actually don't know me. They're, and they're trying to generate clicks. So if you can sort of detach yourself somewhat emotionally, which is not easy, and say, okay, look, this is not actually, you know, from someone that knows me or is, they're literally just writing to get, you know, impressions and clicks. Then, you know, then I I guess it doesn't hurt as much. It's like, it's not quite water or for ducks back, maybe it's like acid or ducks back. All right, well that's good. Just about your own life. What do you as a measure of success in your life? A measure of success, I'd say, like, what, how many useful things can I get done? Day to day basis, you wake up in the morning, how can I be useful today? Yeah, maximized utility area under the code of useful. Very difficult to be useful at scale. That's scale. Can you like speak to what it takes to be useful for somebody like you? Well, there's so many amazing great teams, like how do you allocate your time to be the most useful? Well time time is the true currency. Yeah. So it is tough to say what is the best allocation time. I mean there are, you know often say, if you look at a television te. I mean Tesla this year will do over $100 billion in revenue. So that's $2 billion a week. If I make slightly better decisions, I can affect the outcome by a billion dollars. So then, you know, I try to do the best decisions I can. And on balance, you know, at least compared to the competition, pretty good decisions, but the marginal value of a better decision can easily be in the course of an hour, a hundred billion dollars. Given that, how do you take risks? How do you do the the algorithm that you mentioned?
