We could restore your ability to make memories, but we can't, you know, restore memories that are fully gone. Now, I should say, if maybe if part of the memory is there and the means of accessing the memory is the part that's broken, then we could re-enable the ability to access the memory. So, but you can think of it like RAM in your, you know, in a computer, if, you know, if the RAM is destroyed, or your SD card is destroyed, we can't get that back. But if the connection to the SD card is destroyed, we can fix that. If it is fixable physically, then it can be fixed. Of course with AI you can, just like you can repair photographs and fill in missing parts of photographs, maybe you can do the same. Yeah, you could say like, create the most probable set of memories based on the all information you have about that person. You could then, probably, there would be probable, probabilistic restoration of memory. Now we're getting pretty esoteric here. But that is one of the most beautiful aspects of the human experience is remembering the good memories. Like we, we live most of our life, as Danny Conneman has talked about in our memories, not in the actual moment. We just, we're collecting memories and we kind of relive them in our head and they're that's the good times. If you just integrate over our entire life it's remembering the good times sure that produces the large amount of happiness and so yeah well I mean what are we but our memories and and what is death but the loss of memory? Loss of information. You know if you if you could say like, well, if you could be, you run a thought experiment, if you were disintegrated painlessly and then reintegrated a moment later, like teleportation, I guess, provided there's no information loss, the fact that your one body was disintegrated is irrelevant. And memories is just such a huge part of that. Death is fundamentally the loss of information, the loss of memory. So if we can store them as accurately as possible, we basically achieve a kind of a mortality. Yeah. You've talked about the threats, the safety concerns of AI. Let's look at long-term visions. Do you think Neurlink is in your view the best current approach we have for AI safety? It's an idea that may help with AI safety. Certainly not. I wouldn't want to claim it's like some panacea or something. It's that's a sure thing. But I mean, many years ago I was thinking, well, what, what would inhibit alignment of human, collective human will with artificial intelligence? And the low data rate of humans, especially our slow output rate, would necessarily just because it's such a, because the communication is so slow, would diminish the link between humans and computers. Like the more you are a tree, the less you know what the tree is. Like, let's say you look at a tree, you look at this plant or whatever and like, hey, I'd really like to make that plant happy, but it's not saying a lot, you know. So the more we increase the data rate that humans can intake an output, then, that means the better, the high of the chance we have in a world full of AGI's. Yeah. We could better align collective human will with AI if the output rate especially was dramatically increased. Like, and I think there's potential to increase the output rate by, I don't know, three, maybe six, maybe more orders of magnitude. So, it's better than the current situation. And that output rate would be by increasing the number of electrodes, number of channels, and also maybe implanting multiple neural links. Yeah. Do you think there will be a world in the next couple of decades where it's hundreds of millions of people have neural links? Yeah, I do. Do you think when people just, when they see the capabilities, the superhuman capabilities that are possible, and then the safety is demonstrated? Yeah, if it's extremely safe and you have superhuman abilities, and let's say you can upload your memories, you know, so you wouldn't, you wouldn't lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it. It would supersede the cell phone, for example. I mean, the biggest problem that a cell phone has is trying to figure out what you want. So that's why you figure out what you want. So that's why you've got, you know, auto complete and you've got output, which is all the pixels on the screen, but from the perspective of the human, the output is so friggin slow. Desktop or phone is desperately just trying to understand what you want. And, you know, there's an eternity between every keystroke from a computer's downboing. Yeah. Yeah. The computer's talking to a tree. It's a little movie tree. It's trying to swipe. Yeah. So, you know, if you had computers that are doing trillions of instructions per second, and a whole second went by. I mean, that's a trillion things that could have done. Yeah, I think it's exciting and scary for people because once you have a very high bit rate that changes the human experience in a way that's very hard to imagine. Yeah, it would be, we would be something different. I mean some sort of futuristic side, well, I mean we're obviously talking about it by the way, like it's not like around the corner. It's you ask me what the distant future is like maybe this is like it's not super far away but 10, 15 years, that kind\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
