Yes, yes. That's also one element that was incredibly important for us. So each of these thread are, as I mentioned, 16 micron in width and then they tapered to 84 micron, but in thickness they're less than 5 micron. And in thickness is mostly, you know, polyimid at the bottom the the bottom the the the the the the the the the thickness, they're less than five micron. And in thickness is mostly, you know, polyimid at the bottom and this metal track and then another polyimid. So two micron of polyimid, 400 nanometer of this metal stack and two micron of polyimid sandwiched together to protect it from the environment that is 37 degree C bag of salt water. So what's some, maybe, can you speak to some interesting aspects of the environment that is 37 degrees C bag of salt water. So what's some, maybe, can you speak to some interesting aspects of the material design here? Like what does it take to design a thing like this and to be able to manufacture a thing like this for people who don't know anything about this kind of thing? Yeah, so the material selection that we have is not, I don't think it was particularly unique. There were other labs and there are other labs that are kind of looking at similar material stack. There's kind of a fundamental question and still needs to be answered around the longevity and reliability of these microelectros that we call, compared to some of the other more conventional neural interfaces, devices that are intra-cranial, so penetrating the cortex, that are more rigid, you know, like the Utah Ray, that are these 4-4-millimeter kind of silicon shank that have exposed recording site at the end of it. And you know that's that's been kind of the innovation from Richard Norman back in 1997. It's called the Utah Ray because you know he was at University of Utah. And what does the Utah array look like so it's a rigid type of yeah so we can actually look it up. Yeah yeah so it's a bed of needle. There's... Okay, go ahead. I'm sorry. Those are rigid shank. Rigid. Yeah, you won't get it. The size and the number of shanks vary anywhere from 64 to 128. At the very tip of it is an exposed electrode that actually records neural signal. The other thing that's interesting to note is that unlike neuraling threads that have recording electrodes that are actually exposed iridium oxide recording sites along the depth, this is only at a single death. So these Utah array spokes can be anywhere between 0.5 millimeters to 1.5 millimeter and they also have designs that are slanted so you can have it inserted at different depth. But that's one of the other big differences. And then I mean the main key difference is the fact that there's no active electronics. These are just electrodes and then there's a bundle of a wire that you're seeing and then that actually then exits the craniectomy That then has this port that you can connect to for any external electronic devices They are working on a or have the wireless telemetry device, but it still requires a through the skin Port that actually is one of the biggest failure modes for infection for the system. What is some of the challenges associated with flexible threads? Like for example on the robotic side, R1, implanting those threads, how difficult does that to ask? Yeah, so as you mentioned, they're very, very difficult to maneuver by hand. These youth arrays that you saw earlier, they're very, very difficult to maneuver by hand. These Utah arrays that you saw earlier, they're actually inserted by a neurosurgeon actually positioning it near the site that they want, and then there's a pneumatic hammer that actually pushes them in. So it's a pretty simple process and they're easier to maneuver. But for these thin foam arrays, they're very, very tiny and flexible, so they're very difficult to maneuver. So that's why we built an entire robot to do that. There are other reasons for why we built a robot, and that is ultimately we want this to help millions and millions of people that can benefit from this and there just aren't that many neurosurgeons out there and you know robots can be something that you know we hope can actually do large parts of the surgery but yeah yeah the the robot is this entire other sort of category of product that we're working on and it's essentially this entire other sort of category of product that we're working on. And it's essentially this multi-axis gantry system that has the specialized robot head, that has all of the optics and this kind of a needle retracting mechanism that maneuvers these threads via this loop structure that you have on the thread? So the thread already has a loop structure by which you can grab it? Correct. Correct. So this is fascinating. So you mentioned optics. So there's a robot, R1. So for now there's a human that actually creates a hole in this skull. And then after that, there's a computer vision component that's finding a way to avoid the blood vessels. And then you're grabbing it by the loop each individual thread and placing it in a particular location to avoid the blood vessels and also choosing the depth of placement all that right so controlling every like the 3D geometry of the placement correct so the the aspect of this robot that is unique is that it's not surgeon assisted or human assisted it's a semi-automatic or automatic robot once you know obviously there are human component to it when you're placing targets. You can always move\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
