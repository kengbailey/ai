Elon D.J. Matthew and Bliss are, of course, part of the amazing NeuroLink team. And Nolan is the first human to have a neuralink device implanted in his brain. I speak with each of them individually, so use time stamps to jump around or, as I recommend, go hardcore and listen to the whole thing. This is the longest podcast I've ever done. It's a fascinating, super-technical and wide-ranging conversation, and I loved every minute of it. And now, dear friends, here's Elon Musk, his fifth time on this, the Lex Friedman podcast. Drinking coffee or water? Water. I'm so over-caffinated right now. Do you want some caffeine? I mean, sure. There's a, there's a nitro drink. I'm supposed to keep you up for like, you know, tomorrow afternoon basically. Yeah. I don't have to show it. So what is nitro? It's just got a lot of caffeine or something? Don't ask questions. It's called nitro. Do you need to know anything else? It's got nitrogen. That's ridiculous. I mean, what we breathe  78% nitrogen anyway. What do you need to add more people? Most people think that they're breathing oxygen, and they're actually breathing 78% nitrogen. You need like a milk bar? Like from Clockwork Orange. Yeah. Is that top three Kubrick film for you? It's pretty good. I mean, it's pretty good. I mean it's demanted. Jarring, I'd say. Okay. Okay. So first, let's step back and big congrats on getting neuralink. That's a historic step for NeuralLink. And there's many more to come. Yeah, we just obviously have our second implant as well. How did that go? So far so good. There looks like we've got I think on the order of 400 electrodes that are providing signals. So... Nice. Yeah. How quickly do you think the number of human participants will scale? It depends somewhat on the regulatory approval, the rate which we get regulatory approvals. So we're hoping to do 10 by the end of this year, total of 10. So eight more. And with each one, you're going to be learning a lot of lessons about the neurobiology, the brain, the everything, the whole chain of the neural, the decoding, the signal processing, all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I think it's obviously going to get better with each one. I mean, I don't want to jinx it, but it seems to have gone extremely well with the second implant. So there's a lot of signal, a lot of electrodes. It's working very well. What improvements do you think we'll see in Neuralink in the coming, let's say, let's get crazy in coming years? I mean, in years it's going to be gigantic, because we'll increase the number of electrodes dramatically. We'll improve the number of electrodes dramatically, we'll improve the signal processing. So we with with even with only roughly 10-15 percent of the electrodes working with with Nolan to with our first patient we're able to get to achieve a bits per second that's twice the world record. So I think we'll also it will start like vastly exceeding the world record by origin magnitude in the years come. So it's like getting to I don't know a hundred bits per second, thousand, you know, maybe maybe if it's like five years now it might be at a megabit, like fast than any human could possibly communicate by typing or speaking. Yeah, that BPS is an interesting metric to measure. There might be a big leap in the experience once you reach a certain level of BPS. Yeah. Like entire new ways of interacting with the computer might be unlocked. And with humans. With other humans. Provided they have a neural link too. Right. Otherwise they won't be able to absorb the signals fast enough. Do you think they'll improve the quality of intellectual discourse? Well I think you can you could think of it, you know, if you were to slow down communication, how hard you feel about that? You know, if you'd only talk at let's say one-tenth of normal speed, you'd be like, wow, that's agonizingly slow. Yeah. So now, imagine you could speak it, communicate clearly at ten or a hundred or a thousand times faster than normal. Listen, I'm pretty sure nobody in their right mind listens to me at 1X. They listen to 2X. So I can only imagine what 10X would feel like or I can actually understand it. I usually default to 1.5X. You can do 2X. Well, actually if I'm trying to, if I'm listening to somebody to get to, in like of 15-20 minutes segments to go to sleep, then I'll do it 1.5X. If I'm paying attention, I'll do 2X. Right. But actually, if you start, actually listen to podcasts or sort of audio books or anything at, if you get used to doing it at 1.5, then one sounds painfully slow. I'm still holding on to one because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of myself becoming bored with the reality, with the real world where everyone's speaking on one X. Well, depends on the person you can speak very quickly and also if you use a wide range of, if your vocabulary is larger, your bit rate, effective bit rate is higher. That's a good way to put\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
