Like, it's almost as if it is anticipating what I am going to do again before I go to do it. And so, using attempted movement for 15 minutes, at some point, I can kind of tell when I like move my eyes to the next target that the cursor is starting to like pick up. Like, it's starting to understand, it's learning like what I'm going to do. So first of all, it's really cool that, I mean, you are a true pioneer in all of this. You're like exploring how to do every aspect of this most effectively. And there's just, I imagine so many lessons learned from this. So thank you for being a pioneer and all these kinds of experience when it's calibrated in different ways. Like just because I imagine your brain is doing something different and that's why there's a different feeling to it and then try and define the words and the measurements to those feelings would be also interesting. But at the end of the day you can also measure that your actual performance on whether it's snake or web grid you can see like what actually works well and you're saying for the open loop calibration the attempted movement works best for now. Yep yep so the this is the open loop you don't get the feedback that's something that you did something yeah I'm just frustrating no, it makes sense to me. We've done it with a cursor and without a cursor in open loop. So sometimes it's just, say, for like the center out, you'll start calibration with a bubble lighting up, and I push towards that bubble, and then when that bubble, you know, when it's pushed towards that bubble for, say, three seconds a bubble will pop, and th, and th, and th, and th, and th, and th,, and that, and that, and that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that bubble and then when that bubble, you know, when it's pushed towards that bubble for say three seconds a bubble will pop and then I come back to the middle. So I'm doing it all just by my intentions, like that's what it's learning anyway. So it makes sense that as long as I follow what they want me to do, you know, like, follow the yellow brick road, that it'll all work out. You're full of great references. Is the bubble game fun? Like yeah, they always feel so bad making me do calibration like oh we're about to do you know a 40 minute calibration. I'm like all right you guys want to do two of them. Like I'm always asking to like whatever they need I'm more than happy to do. And it's not, it's not bad. Like I get to lie there and, or sit in my chair and like do these things with some great people. I get to have great conversations. I can give them feedback. I can talk about all sorts of things. I could throw something on on my TV in the background and kind of like split my attention between them. Like it's not bad at all. I don't mind- Is there a score that you get? Like can you do better on the bubble game? No, I would love that. I would love, yeah. Writing down, suggestions from Nolan. That's a... Make it more fun, game-fied. Yeah, that's one thing that I really, really enjoy about Web Grid is, because I'm the the thii-like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, that's one thing that I really, really enjoy about WebGrid is because I'm so competitive. Like the higher the BPS, the higher the score, I know the better I'm doing. And so if I, I think I've asked at one point one of the guys, like if he could give me some sort of numerical feedback for calibration. I would like to know what they're looking out, like, oh, you know, it is, we see like this number while you're th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, to know what they're looking at like, oh, you know, it is, we see like this number while you're doing calibration and that means, at least on our end, that we think calibration is going well. And I would love that because I would like to know if what I'm doing is going well or not, but then I've also told me like, yeah, not necessarily like one to one. It doesn't actually mean that calibration is going well in some ways, so it's not like 100% and they\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
