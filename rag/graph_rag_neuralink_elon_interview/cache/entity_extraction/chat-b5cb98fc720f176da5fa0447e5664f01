There was a huge language barrier and there was a lot of struggle to kind of connect with my peers around me because I didn't understand the artificial construct that we have created called language, specifically English in this case. And I remember feeling pretty isolated, not being able to connect with peers around me. So I spent a lot of time just on my own, you know, reading books, watching movies. And I naturally sort of gravitated towards sci-fi books. I just found them really, really interesting. And also it was a great way for me to learn English. You know, some of the first set of books that I picked up are Ender's Game, you know, the whole saga, by Orson Scott Card, and Neuromancer from Mulliam Gipson and Snow Crash from Neil Stevenson, and, you know, movies like Matrix was coming out around that time point that really influenced how I think about the potential impact that technology can have for our lives in general. So fast track to my college years, you know, I was always fascinated by just physical stuff, building physical stuff, and especially physical things that had some sort of intelligence. And, you know, I studied electrical engineering during undergrad, and I started out my research in MEMS, so microelectron mechanical systems, and really building these tiny nanostructures for temperature sensing, and I just found that to be just incredibly rewarding and fascinating to just understand how you can build something miniature like that, that again, serve a function and had a purpose. And then, you know, I spent a large majority of my college years basically building millimeter wave circuits for next-gen telecommunication systems, for imaging, and it was just something that I found very, very intellectually interesting, you know, phase arrays, how the signal processing works for, you know, any modern as well as next gen telecommunication system, wireless and wireline. EM waves or electromagnetic waves are fascinating. How do you design antennas that are most efficient in a small footprint that you have? How do you make these things energy efficient? That was something that just consumed my intellectual curiosity. And that journey led me to actually apply to and find myself at PhD program at UC Berkeley, at kind of this consortium called the Berkeley Wireless Research Center that was precisely looking at building, at the time we called it XG, you know, similar to 3G, 4G, 5G, but the next next generation, G system, and how you would design circuits around that to ultimately go on phones and basically any other devices that are wirelessly connected these days. So I was just absolutely just fascinated by how that entire system works and that infrastructure works. And then also during grad school, I had sort of the fortune of having, you know, a couple of research fellowships that let me to kind of pursue your intellectual curiosity in the domain that may not matter at the end of the day, but it's something that really allows you the opportunity to go as deeply as you want as well as as widely as you want. And at the time I was actually working on this project called the Smart Bandaid. And the idea was that when you get a wound, there's a lot of other kind of proliferation of signaling pathway that cells follow to close that wound. And there were hypotheses that when you apply external electric field, you can actually accelerate the closing of that field by having basically electro-taxing of the cells around that wound site. And specifically, not just for normal wound, there are chronic wounds that don't heal. So we were interested in building some sort of a wearable patch that you could apply to kind of facilitate that healing process. And that was in collaboration with Professor Michel Mohavitz, which was a great addition to my thesis committee and really shaped rest of my PhD career. So this would be the first time you interacted with biology, I suppose. Correct, correct. I mean, there were some peripheral end application of the wireless imaging and telecommunication system that I was using for security and bioimaging, but this was a very clear direct application to biology and biological system and understanding the constraints around that and really designing and engineering electrical solutions around it. So that was my first introduction and that's also kind of how I got introduced to Michelle. You know, he's sort of known for remote control of Beatles in the early 2000s. And then around 2013, you know, obviously kind of the holy grail when it comes to implanable system is to kind of understand how small of a thing you can make and a lot of that is driven by how much energy or how much power you can supply to it and how you extract data from it. So at the time at Berkeley, there was kind of this desire to kind of understand in the neural space what what sort of system you can build to really miniaturize these implantable systems. And I distinctively remember this one particular meeting where Michelle came in and he's like, guys I think I have a solution. The solution is ultrasound. And then he proceeded to kind of walk through why that is the case. And that really formed a basis for my thesis work called neural dust system that was looking at ways to use ultrasound as opposed to electromagnetic waves for powering as well as communication. I guess I should step back and say the initial goal of the project was to build these tiny About a size of a neuron implantable system that can be parked next to a neuron being able to record its state and being able to Ping that back to the outside world for doing something useful, and as I mentioned, the size of the Implantable system is limited by how you power the thing and get the data off of it.
