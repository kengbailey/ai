If I make slightly better decisions, I can affect the outcome by a billion dollars. So then, you know, I try to do the best decisions I can. And on balance, you know, at least compared to the competition, pretty good decisions, but the marginal value of a better decision can easily be in the course of an hour, a hundred billion dollars. Given that, how do you take risks? How do you do the the algorithm that you mentioned? I mean, deleting, given a small thing can be a billion dollars. How do you decide to... Yeah. Well I think you have to look at it on a percentage basis because if you look at it in the absolute terms it's it's just I would never get any sleep. It's it would just be like I need to just keep working and work my brain harder, you know. And I'm not trying to get as much as possible out of this meat computer. So it's not, it's pretty hard because you can just work all the time and at any given point, like I said, a slightly better decision could be a hundred million dollar impact for Tesla or SpaceX for that matter. But it is wild when considering the marginal value of time can be a hundred million dollars an hour at times or more. Is your own happiness part of that equation of success? It has to be to some degree other if I'm sad. If I'm depressed, depressed I make worse decisions. So I can't have like if I have zero recreational time then I make work worse decisions. So I don't know a lot but it's above zero. I mean my motivation if I've got a religion of any kind is a religion of a religion of curiosity of trying to understand, you know, it's really the mission of Groc, understand the universe, I'm trying to understand the universe, or at least set things in motion such that at some point civilization understands the universe, far better than we do today. And even what questions to ask. As Douglas Adams pointed out in his book, sometimes the answer is arguably the easy part. Trying to frame the question correctly is the hard part. Once you frame the question correctly, the answer is often easy. So, um, I'm trying to set things in motion such that we are at least at some point able to understand the universe. So for SpaceX, the goal is to make life multiplanetary. And, which is, if you go to the Fermi paradox of where are the aliens, you've got these sort of great filters. Like, it's like, why have we not heard from the aliens? Now, a lot of people think there are aliens among us. I often claim to be one, which nobody believes me, but it did say alien registration card at one point on my immigration documents. So I've not seen any evidence of aliens. So it suggests that, at least one of the explanations is that intelligent life is extremely rare. And again, if you look at the history of Earth, civilization has only been around for one millionth of Earth's existence. So if, you know, if Halens had visited here, say, 100,000 years ago, they would be like, well, they don't even have writing, you know, just hunter-gatherers, basically. So, um, so how long does a civilization last? So, for SpaceX, the goal is to... So how long does a civilization last? So for SpaceX, the goal is to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. Mars is the only viable planet for such a thing. The moon is close, but it lacks resources, and I think it's probably vulnerable to any calamity that takes out Earth could, the moon is too close, it's vulnerable to a calamity that takes out earth. So, I'm not saying we shouldn't have a moon base, but Mars is far more resilient. The difficulty of getting to Mars is what makes it resilient. So, but in going through the these various explanations of why don't we see the aliens, why one of them is that they fail to pass these great filters, these key hurdles, and one of them is that they fail to pass these great filters, these key hurdles. And one of those hurdles is being a multi-planet species. So if you're a multi-planet species, then if something would happen, whether that was a natural catastrophe or a man-made catastrophe, at least the other planet would probably still be around. So you're not like, you don't have all the eggs in one basket. And once you are sort of a two-planet species, you can obviously extend to, extend life halves to the asteroid belt, maybe to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and ultimately to other star systems. But if you can't even get to another planet, you know, definitely not getting to star systems. And the other possible great filters, super powerful technology like AGI, for example. So you're basically trying to knock out one great filter at a time. Digital Superintelligence is possibly a great filter. I hope it isn't, but it might be. You know, guys like say Jeff Hinton would say, you know, has he invented a number of the key principles in artificial intelligence. I think he's puts the probability of AI annihilation around 10 to 20 percent, something like that. So, you know, so it's not, like, you know, look on the right side, it's a 80 percent likely to be great. So, but I think AI risk mitigation is important. Being a multi-planned species would be a massive risk mitigation. And I do want to sort of, once again, emphasize the importance of having enough children to sustain our numbers and not go in, not plummet into population collapse, which is currently happening.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
