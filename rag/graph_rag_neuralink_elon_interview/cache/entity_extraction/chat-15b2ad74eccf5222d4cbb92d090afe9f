So typically the general good rule of thumb is you want to leave the nature as is and not disrupt it as much. the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the future the scar tissue formation. So typically, the general good rule of thumb is you want to leave the nature as is and not disrupt it as much. So we're looking at ways to insert the threats through the thorough, which comes with different needle thrown, which comes with different theate and the loop engagement. Such as, you know, it's a pretty thick thick the needle. So we're looking at different needle design for that as well as the kind of the loop engagement. The other biggest challenges are it's quite opaque, optically, and with white light illumination. So how do you avoid still, still avoid still, how do you image through that? So there are other imaging techniques that we're looking at to enable that. But the goal, our hypothesis is that and based on some of the early evidence that we have, doing through the Dura insertion will cause minimal scarring that causes them to be much easier to extract over time. And the other thing that we're also looking at this is going to be a fundamental change in the implant architecture is at the moment it's a monolithic single implant that comes with a thread that's bonded together so you can't actually separate the thing out but you can imagine having two-part implant, you know bottom part that is the thread that are inserted that has the chips and maybe a radio and some power source and then you have another implant that has the chips and maybe a radio and some power source. And then you have another implant that has more of the computational heavy load and the bigger battery. And then one can be under the d'rout, one can be above the d'rout, like being the plug for the skull. They can talk to each other, but the thing that you want to upgrade the threads, if you want to upgrade that, you just go in there, you know, remove the screws and then put in the next version and, you know, you're off the, you know, it's a very, very easy surgery too. Like you do a skin incision, slip this in, screw, probably be able to the natural question of what is the pathway to scaling the increase in the number of threads? Is that a priority? Is it like what's the technical challenge there? Yeah that is a priority so for next versions of the implant you know the key metrics that we're looking to improve are number of channels just recording from more and more neurons. You know we have a pathway to actually go from currently 1,000 to hopefully 3,000, if not 6,000 by end of this year. And then end of next year, we want to get to, you know, even more, 16,000. Wow. There's a couple limitations to that. One is, obviously, being able to photo lithographically print those wires. As I mentioned, it's two micron in widths. Obviously there are chips that are much more advanced than those types of resolution and we have some of the tools that we have brought in-house to be able to do that. So traces will be narrower just so that you have to have more of the wires coming up into the chip. Chips also cannot linearly consume more energy as you have more and more channels. So there's a lot of innovations in the circuit, you know, architecture as well as the circuit design topology to make them lower power. You need to also think about if you have all of these spikes, how do you send that off to the end application. So you need to think about bandwidth limitation there and potentially innovations in signal processing. Physically, one of the biggest challenges is going to be the interface. It's always the interface that breaks. Bonding the thin film array to the electronics, it starts to become very, very highly dense interconnects. So how do you connectctorize that? There's a lot of innovations in kind of the 3D integrations in the recent years that we can take advantage of. One of the biggest challenges that we do have is forming this hermetic barrier, right? You know, this is an extremely harsh environment that we're in, the brain. So how do you protect it from, yeah, like the brain trying to kill to kill to kill to kill to kill to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to to to the the to the the the the the the the, the the, the the the and kind, the the, the the the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, in in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in're in the brain. So how do you protect it from yeah like the brain trying to kill your electronics to also your electronics leaking things that you don't want into the brain and that forming that hermetic barrier is going to be a very very big challenge that we are you know I think are actually well suited to tackle. How do you test that? Like what's the development environment? Yeah, to simulate that kind of harshness. Yeah, so this is this is where the accelerated life tester essentially is a brain and a vat. It literally is a vessel that is made up of, and again, again, for all intents and purpose for this particular types of tests, your brain is a salt water. And, uh, and you can also put some other\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
