You're swapping out different experiences and with neural link being able to control that, primarily at first to improve function, not for entertainment purposes or enjoyment purposes, but... Yeah, giving back lost functions. Well, giving back lost functions. And they're... That's special when the function is completely lost, anything is a huge help. Would you implant a Neural link device in your own brain? Absolutely. I mean, maybe not right now, but absolutely. What kind of capability once reached you start getting real curious and almost get jealous of people that get as you watch them get implanted? Yeah, I mean, I think, even even with our early participants if they start to do things that I can't do, which I think is in the realm of possibility for them to be able to get 15, 20, if not like 100 BPS, right? There's nothing that fundamentally stops us from being able to achieve that type of performance. I mean, I will certainly get jealous that they can do that. I should say that watching Nolan, I get a little jealous because he's having so much fun. And it seems like such a chill way to play video games. Yeah. So, I mean, the thing that also is hard to appreciate sometimes is that, you know, he's doing these things while like, while talking and, I mean, it's multitasking, right? So it's clearly, it's obviously cognitive, cognitively intensive, but similar to how, you know, when we talk, we move our hands, like these things like, you know, you are multitasking. I mean, he's able to do that and you know you won't be able to do that with other assist of technology as far as I'm aware you know if you're obviously using like an eye-tracking device you know you're very much fixated on that thing that you're trying to do andthat. Yeah, the multitasking aspect of that is really interesting. So it's not just the BPS for the primary task, it's the, it's the parallelization of multiple tasks. If you take, if you measure the BPS for the entirety of the human organism, so if you're talking and doing a thing with your mind and looking around also. I mean there's just a lot of paralyzation that can they can be happening. But I mean I think at some point for him like if he wants to really achieve those high-level BPS it does require like you know full attention right and that's a separate circuitry that that is a big mystery like how attention works and you know. Yeah attention like cognitive load have done, I've read a lot of literature on people doing two tasks. Like you have your primary task and a secondary task, and the secondary task is a source of distraction. And how does that affect the performance on the primary task? And there's depending on the task. there's a lot of interesting, the interesting computational device, right? And I think there's, to say the least, a lot of novel insights that can be gained from everything. I mean, I personally am surprised that no one is able to do such incredible control of the cursor while talking. And also being nervous at the same time, because he's talking like all of us if you're talking in front of the camera, you get nervous. So all of those are coming into play and he's able to still achieve high performance. Surprising. I mean all of this is really amazing and I think just after researching this really in depth I kind of get in the line. And also the safety get in mind. Well we should say the registry is for people who have quadriplegia and all that kind of stuff so correct there'll be a separate line for people. They're just curious like myself. So now that Nolan patient P1 is part of the ongoing prime study. What's the high level vision for P2, P3, P4, P5 and just the expansion into other human beings that are getting to experience this implant? Yeah, I mean the primary goal is for our study in the first place is to achieve safety endpoints, just understand safety of this device as well as the implantation process. And also at the same time, understand the efficacy and the impact that it could have on the potential user's lives. And just because you have, and you know, you're living with tetraplegia, it doesn't mean your situation as same as another person living with tetrapleasia. It's wildly, widely varying. And you know, it's something that, you know, we're hoping to also understand how our technology can serve not just a very small slice of those individuals, but, you know, broader group of individuals and being able to get the feedback to you know just really build just the best product for them. So our you know there's obviously also you know goals that we have and the primary purpose of the early feasibility study is to learn from each and every participants to improve the device, improve the surgery before, you know, we embark on what's called a pivotal study that then is a much larger trial that starts to look at statistical significance of your endpoints. And that's required before you can then market the device. And,that's how it works in the US and just generally around the world. That's the process you follow. So, you know, our goal is to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
