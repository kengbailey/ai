You can't see them on CT, but if you trust the merging of the two images, then you indirectly know on the CT where that is and therefore indirectly know where in reference to the titanium frame screwed to their head those targets are. And so this is 60s technology to manually compute trajectories given the entry point and target and dial in some goofy looking titanium actuators with manual actuators with little tick marks on them. The modern version of that is to use a robot. You know, just like a little Kuka arm, you might see it building cars at the Tesla factory. This small robot arm can show you the trajectory that you intended from the pre-op MRI and establish a very rigid holder through which you can drill a small hole in the skull and pass a small rigid wire deep into that area of the brain that's hollow and put your electrode through that hollow wire and then remove all of that except the electrode. So you end up with the electrode very, very precisely placed far from the skull surface. Now that's standard technology that's already, you know, been out in the world for a while. Neurlink right now is focused entirely on cortical targets, surface targets, because there's no trivial way to get, say, hundreds of wires deep inside the brain without doing a lot of damage. So, your question, what do you see? Well, I see an MRI on a screen. I can't see everything that that DBS electrode is passing through on its way to that deep target. And so it's accepted with this approach that there's going to be about one and a hundred patients who have a bleed somewhere in the brain. As a result of passing that wire blindly into the deep part of the brain. That's not an acceptable safety profile for Neurlink. We start from the position that we want this to be dramatically maybe two or three orders of magnitude safer than that. Safe enough really that you know you or I without a profound medical problem might on our lunch break some day say yeah sure I'll get that. I'd or I without a profound medical problem might on our lunch break someday say yeah sure I'll get that I'd be meaning to upgrade to the latest version and so that the safety constraints given that are high and so we haven't settled on a final solution for arbitrarily approaching deep targets in the brain. It's interesting because you have to avoid blood vessels somehow. You have to, maybe there's creative ways of doing the same thing, like mapping out high-resolution geometry of blood vessels, and then you can go in blind. But like how do you map out that in a way that's like super stable? It's in that. There's a lot of interesting challenges there, right? Yeah. But there's a lot to do on the surface. Exactly. So we've got vision on the surface. You know, we actually have made a huge amount of progress sewing electrodes into the spinal cord as a potential workaround for a spinal cord injury that would allow a brain-mounted implant to translate motor intentions to a spine-mounted implant that can affect muscle contractions in previously paralyzed arms and legs. That's just incredible. So like the effort there is to try to bridge the brain to the spinal cord, to the peripheral nervous. So, what, how hard is that to do? We have that working in very crude forms and animals. That's amazing. Yeah, we've done it. So similar to like with Nolan, where he's able to digitally move the cursor. Here you're doing the same kind of communication, but with the actual effectors that you have. Yeah, that's fascinating. Yeah, so we have anesthetized animals doing grasp and moving moving their legs and a sort of walking pattern again early days but the future is bright for this kind of thing and and people with paralysis should look forward to that bright future.this kind of thing and people with paralysis should look forward to that bright future. They're going to have options. Yeah and there's a lot of sort of intermediate or extra options where you take like an optimist robot like the the arm and to be able to control the arm, the the fingers, the hands of the arm. Sure. As a prosthetic, for example, skeletons are getting better too. So skeletons. Yeah, so that goes hand in hand. Although I didn't quite understand until thinking about a deep and doing more research about Neurolink, how much you can do on the digital side. So there's digital telepathy. Yeah, I didn't quite understand that you could really map The intention as you described in the hand knob area that you can map the intention just imagine it think about it that intention can be mapped to actual action in the digital world. And now more and more, so much can be done in the digital world that it can reconnect you to the outside world. It can allow you to have freedom, have independence if you're a quadriplegic. That's really powerful. Like you can go really far with that. Yeah, our first participant is, he's incredible. He's breaking world records left and right. And he's having fun with it, it's great. Just going back to the surgery, your whole journey, you mentioned to me off the line, you have surgery on Monday. So you're like you're doing surgery all the time. Yeah, maybe the ridiculous question. What does it take to get good at surgery? Practice, repetitions. You just, same with anything else. You know, there's a million ways of people saying the same thing and selling books saying it, but you call it 10,000 hours? Do you call it, you know, spend some chunk of your life, some percentage of your life focusing on this, obsessing about getting better at it. Repetitions, humility, recognizing that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
