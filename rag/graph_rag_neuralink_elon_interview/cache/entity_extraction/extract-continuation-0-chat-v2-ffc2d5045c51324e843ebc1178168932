Yeah. And you do that by imagining like fake it till you make it. And all of a sudden it creates the right kind of signal that if decoded correctly, can create the kind of effect. And then there's like noise around that they have to figure all of that out, but on the human side Imagine the cursor moving is what you have to do. Yeah, he says using the force of force. I mean, that's isn't that just like fascinating to you that it works? Like to me, it's like, holy shit. That actually works. Like you could move a cursor with your mind. As much as you're learning to use that thing, that thing's also learning about you. Like our model is constantly updating the weights to say, oh if if someone is thinking about, you know, this sophisticated forms of like spiking patterns like that actually means to do this, right? So the the machine is learning about the human and the human is learning about the machine. So there is a adaptability to the signal to the signal the signal the signal the signal the signal the signal the signal the the the the th also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also the the the the the the the the thi, thi thi thi thi the the thi thi tho the tho the th also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also the the the the  means to do this, right? So the machine is learning about the human and the human is learning about the machine. So there is adaptability to the signal processing, the decoding step, and then there's the adaptation of Nolan and the human being. Like the same way, if you give me a new mouse and I move it, I learn very quickly about its sensitivity, so I'll learn to move it slower. And then there's other kind of signal drift and all that kind of stuff they have to adapt to. So both are adapting to each other. Correct. That's a fascinating like software challenge on both sides. The software on both on the human software and the organic and the organic and the organic. Anyway so sorry to rudely interrupt. So there's a selection that Nolan has passed with flying colors. So everything including that it's a BCI friendly home, all of that. So what is the process of the surgery, the implantation in the first moment when he gets to use the system. The end-to-end, you know, we say patient-in-to-patient out is anywhere between two to four hours, in particular case for Nolan, it was about three and a half hours, and there's many steps leading to, you know, the actual robot insertion, right? So there's anesthesia, induction, and we do intra-op CT imaging to make sure that we're, you know, drilling the hole in the right location. And this is also pre-plan beforehand. Someone goes through, someone like Nolan would go through FMRI and then they can think about wiggling their hand, you know, obviously due to their injury, it's not going to actually lead to any sort of intended output, but it's the same part of the brain that actually lights up when you're imagining moving your finger to actually moving your finger. And that's one of the ways in which we can actually know where to place our threads. Because we want to go into what's called the hand knob area in the mortal cortex and you know as as much as possible densely put our electro threads. So yeah, we do intra-op CT imaging to make sure and double check the location of the craniacetomy. And surgeon comes in, does their thing in terms of like skin incision, craniacomy, so drilling of the skull, and then there's many different layers of the brain. There's what's called the dura, which is a very, very thick layer that surrounds the brain. That gets actually resected in a process called directomy. And that then exposed the Pia and the brain that you want to insert. And by the time it's been around anywhere between one to one and a half hours, robot comes in, does this thing, placement of the target, inserting of the thread. That takes anywhere between 20 to 40 minutes in the particular case for Nolan, it was just under or just over 30 minutes, and then after that the surgeon comes in, there's a couple other steps of like actually inserting the derail substitute layer to protect the thread as well as the brain and then yeah screw in the implant and then skin flat and then suture and then you're out. So when Nolan woke up, what was that like? Was the recovery like and what was the first time he was able to use it? So he was actually immediately after the surgery, you know, like an hour after the surgery as he was waking up. We did turn on the device, make sure that we are recording neural signals. And we actually did have a couple signals that we noticed that he can actually modulate. And what I mean by modulate is that he can think about crunching his fist and you could see the spike disappear and appear. That's awesome.
