It takes a lot of focus. It was a lot easier at the beginning because I wasn't able to like control a TV in my room or anything. I wasn't able to control any of my environment. So for the first few years, a lot of what I was doing was staring at walls. And so, obviously, I did a lot of what I was doing was staring at walls and so Obviously I did a lot of thinking and I tried to move a lot just over and over and over again Do you never give up sort of hope there? No. Training hard essentially. Yep, and I still do it. I do it like subconsciously and I think that that helped a lot with things with Neurlink honestly it's something that I talked about the other day at the all hands that I did at Neurlink's Austin facility. Welcome to Austin mother. Yeah Hey thanks man I would thanks thanks man the gigafactory was super cool I went to school. I went to school at Texas A&M, so I've been around before. So you should be saying, welcome to me. Yeah. Welcome to Texas. Yeah. I hit you. But yeah, I was talking about how a lot of what they've had me do, especially at the beginning, well, I still do it now, is body mapping. So, like, there will be a visualization of a hand or an arm on the screen and I have to do that motion and that's how they sort of train the algorithm to like understand what I'm trying to do and so it made things very seamless for me I think. That's really really cool so it's it's amazing to know because I've learned a lot about the body mapping procedure like with like with the interface and everything like that. It's cool to know, because I've learned a lot about the body mapping procedure. Like with the interface and everything like that, it's cool to know that you've been a century like training to be like world class at that task. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if other quadriplegics, like other paralyzed people give up. I hope they don't. I hope they keep trying because I've heard other paralyzed people say like don't ever stop. They tell you two years but you just never know. You're the human body's capable of amazing things. So I've heard other people say don't give up. Like I think one girl had spoken to me through some family members and said that she had been paralyzed, you know, for 18 years and she'd been trying to like wiggle her index finger for all that time and she finally got a bat like 18 years later. So like I know that it's possible and I'll never give up doing it. I just, I do it when I'm lying down like watching TV. I'll find myself doing it kind of just almost like on its own. It's just something I've gotten so used to doing that I don't know I don't think I'll ever stop. That's really awesome to hear because I think it's one of those things that can really pay off in the the moment. But like there's a like Olympic level nervous system getting getting ready for something. Which honestly was like something that I think Neurlink gave me that I can't think them enough for like I can't show my appreciation for it enough was being able to visually see that what I'm doing is actually having some effect. It's a huge part of the reason why I know now that I'm going to keep doing it forever. Because before Neurlink, I was doing it every day and I was just assuming that things were happening. Like it's not like I knew. I wasn't getting back any mobility or sensation or anything. So I could have been running up against a brick wall for all I knew. And with Neurlink, I get to see like all the signals happening real time. And I get to see that you know what I'm doing can actually be mapped you know when we started doing like click calibrations and stuff when I go to click my index finger for a left click that it actually recognizes that like it it changed how I think about what's possible with like retraining my body to move and So yeah, I'll I'll never give up now and also just the signal that there's still a powerhouse of a brain there That's like exas and as the technology develops that brain is I mean, that's the most important thing about the human body is the brain and it can you first could wiggle the index finger and saw the environment respond like that little? Yeah, it was wherever it was being way too dramatic according to you. Yeah, it was very cool. I mean, it was cool, but it, I keep telling this to people, it made sense to me. Like it made sense that, you know, like there are signals still happening in my brain, and that as long as you had something near it that could measure those, that could record those, then you should be able to like visualize it in some way, like, see it happen. And so that was not very surprising to me. I was just like, oh, cool, like, we found one, like we found something that works. It was cool to see that their technology worked, and that everything th. thi thiiiiiiii. th. th. th. thi something that works. It was cool to see that their technology worked and that everything that they'd worked so hard for was like going to pay off. But I hadn't like moved a cursor or anything at that point. I had like interacted with a computer or anything at that point. So it, it just made sense. It was cool. I didn't really know much about B\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
