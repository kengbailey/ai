It's also how I connect to the computer just in general. So they've given me a lot of voice controls with it at this point. So I can, you know, say, connect or implant disconnect. And as long as I have that charger handy, then I can connect to it. So the charger is also how I connect to the link app to connect the computer. I have to have the implant charger over my head when I want to connect to have it wake up because the implants in hibernation mode, like always when I'm not using it. I think there's a setting to like wake it up every you know so long so we could set it to half an hour or five hours or something if I just wanted to wake up periodically. So yeah I'll like connect to the link app and then go through all sorts of things. Calibration for the day maybe body mapping I have, I made them give me like a little homework tab because I am very forgetful and I forget to do things a lot. So I have like a lot of data collection things that they want me to do. Is the body mapping part of the data collection or is that also part of the convention? Yeah, it is. It's something that they want me to do daily, which I've been slacking on because I've been doing so much media and traveling and so much. So I've been super famous. Yeah, I've been a terrible first candidate for how much I've been slacking on my homework. But yeah, it's just something they want me to do every day to, you know, track how well the Neurlink is performing over time and have something to give, I imagine to give to the FDA to, you know, create all sorts of fancy charts and stuff and show like, hey, this is what the Neurlink, this is how it's performing, you know, day one versus day to thes like that. What's the calibration step like? Is it, is it like, move left, move right? It's a bubble game, so there will be like yellow bubbles that pop up on the screen. At first it is open loop. So open loop. This is something that I still don't fully understand the open loop and closed loop thing. I mean and Blitz talked for a long time about the difference between the two from the on the technical side. Okay. So it'd be great to hear your side of the story. Open loop is basically, I have no control over the cursor. The cursor will be moving on its own across the screen and I am following by intention the cursor to different bubbles and then my, the algorithm is training off what like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like the signals like the signals like the signals like the signals like the cursor to different bubbles and then my the algorithm is training off of what like the signals it's getting are as I'm doing this. There are a couple different ways that they've done it. They call it center out target so there will be a bubble in the middle and then eight bubbles around that and the cursor will go from the middle to one side so say middle to the middle back to middle to up the middle to one side, so say middle to left, back to middle to up to middle like upright and they'll do that all the way around the circle and I will follow that cursor the whole time and then it will train off of my intentions what it is expecting my intentions to be throughout the whole process. Can you actually speak to when you say follow? Yes. You don't mean with your eyes, you mean with your intentions. Yeah, so generally for calibration I'm doing attempted movements because I think it works better. I think the better models as I progress through calibration make it easier to use imagine movements. Wait, wait, wait. So calibrated on attempted movement will create a model that makes it really effective for you to then use the force. Yes. I've tried doing calibration with imagined movement and it just doesn't work as well for some reason. So that was the center out targets. There's also one where you know a random target will pop up on the screen and it's the same. I just like move, I follow along with wherever the cursor is to that target all across the screen. I've tried those with imagined movement and for some reason the models just don't, they don't give as high levels quality when we get into close loop. I haven't played around with it a ton so maybe like the different ways that we're doing calibration now might make it a bit better, but what I've found is there will be a point in calibration where I can use imagine movement. Before that point, it doesn't really work. So if I do calibration for 45 minutes, the first 15 minutes, I can't use imagine movement. It just like doesn't work for some reason. And after a certain point, I, I, I can't use, I can't use imagined movement. It just like doesn't work for some reason. And after a certain point, I can just sort of feel it, I can tell. It moves different. That's the best way I can describe it. Like, it's almost as if it is anticipating what I am going to do again before I go to do it. And so, using attempted movement for 15 minutes, at some point, I can kind of tell when I like move my eyes to the next target that the cursor is starting to like pick up. Like, it's starting to understand, it's learning like what I'm going to do. So first of all, it's really cool that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEURLINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neurlink is a company developing brain-machine interface technology, which the speaker is using for various tasks such as calibration and body mapping)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Food and Drug Administration, which is likely to receive performance data of the Neurlink for regulatory purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLITZ<|>PERSON<|>Blitz is a person who discussed the technical aspects of open loop and closed loop systems with the speaker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINK APP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Link App is an application used to connect the Neurlink implant to a computer for various tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIBRATION<|>EVENT<|>Calibration is a daily task involving the Neurlink, where the user follows a cursor on the screen to train the algorithm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BODY MAPPING<|>EVENT<|>Body mapping is a daily task required by Neurlink to track the performance of the implant over time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA COLLECTION<|>EVENT<|>Data collection involves gathering information on the Neurlink's performance, which is likely used for analysis and regulatory purposes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURLINK<|>FDA<|>Neurlink is likely to provide performance data to the FDA for regulatory purposes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURLINK<|>LINK APP<|>The Link App is used to connect the Neurlink implant to a computer<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURLINK<|>CALIBRATION<|>Calibration is a process involving the Neurlink to train its algorithm<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURLINK<|>BODY MAPPING<|>Body mapping is a task required by Neurlink to track its performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURLINK<|>DATA COLLECTION<|>Data collection is a task required by Neurlink to gather performance data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLITZ<|>NEURLINK<|>Blitz discussed the technical aspects of Neurlink's open loop and closed loop systems with the speaker<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
