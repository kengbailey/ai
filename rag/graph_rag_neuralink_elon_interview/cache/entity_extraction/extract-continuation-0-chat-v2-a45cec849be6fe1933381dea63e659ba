That's the simplest form of the game. academic work and at Neurlink internally with sort of NHPs have all been matched or beaten by Nolan with his Neurlink device. So sort of prior to Neurlink the sort of world record for a human using device is somewhere between 4.2 to 4.6 BPS depending on exactly what paper you read and how you interpret it. Nolan's current record is 8.5 BPS and again the sort of median neural in performance is 10 BPS. So you can think of it roughly as he's 85% the level of control of a median neurolinker using their cursor to select blue targets on the screen. And yeah, I think there's a very interesting journey ahead to get us to that same level of 10 BPS performance. It's not the case that sort of the tricks that got us from, you know, 4 to 6 BPS and then 6 to 8 BPS are gonna be the ones that get us from 8 to 10. And in my view, the core challenge here is really the labeling problem. It's how do you understand at a very, very fine resolution, to work on this problem. What's the journey with Nolan on that quest of increasing the BPS on WebGrid? In March, you said that he selected 89,285 targets in WebGrid. So he loves this game. He's really serious about improving his performance in this game. So what is that journey of trying to figure out how to improve that performance? How much can that be done on the decoding side? How much can that be done on the calibration side? How much can that be done on the Nolan side of like figuring out how to convey his intention more cleanly? Yeah, no, this is a great question. So in my view, one of the primary reasons why Nolan's performance is so good, is extremely focused and very energetic. He'll play webgrid sometimes for like four hours in the middle of the night, like from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. he'll be playing webgrid just because he wants to push it to the limits of what he can do. And you know, this is not us, like asking him to do that. I want to be clear. We're not saying, like that we that we that we th. We're not saying, like th. We're not saying, like not saying, like not saying, like not saying, like not saying, like not saying, like not saying, like not saying, like thanGreek tonight. We just gave him the game as part of our research, you know, and he is able to play independently and practice whenever he wants and he really pushes hard to push it. The technology is the absolute limit. And he views that as like, you know, you know, his job really to make us the thea. And boy, has he done that well. I've also had the privilege to meet other clinical trial participants from brain gain and other trials, and they very much share the same attitude of like, they viewed this as their life's work to advance the technology as much as they can. And if that means selecting targets on the screen for four hours from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. Okay, so now how do you sort of get from where he started, which is no cursor control to 8PPS? So, I mean, when he started, there's a huge amount of learning to do on his side and our side to figure out what's the most intuitive control for him. And the most intuitive control for him is, sort of, you have to signal to decode? So we don't pick up, you know, every single neuron in the motor cortex, which means we don't have representation for every part of the body. So there may be some signals that we have better sort of decode performance on than others. For example, on his left hand, we have a lot of difficulty the detected from the neurons who were able to record for his pinky and his stump and his index finger. So you can imagine how these different you know subspaces of modulated activity intersect with what's the most intuitive for him. And this has evolved over time. So once we gave him the ability to calibrate models on his own, he was able to go and explore various different ways to imagine controlling the cursor. For example he could imagine controlling the cursor by wiling his wrist side to side, or by moving his entire arm, by the key, he tried a whole bunch of stuff to explore the space of what is the most natural way for him to control the cursor that at the same time it's easy for us to decode. Just to clarify, it's through the body mapping procedure that you're able to figure out which finger he can move? Yes, yes, that's one way to do it. Maybe one nuance of the, when he's doing it, he can imagine many more things than we represent in that visual on the screen. So we show him sort of abstractly, here's a cursor. You figure out what works the best for you. And we obviously have hints about what will work best from that body mapping procedure. We know that this particular action we can represent well well well well well well up to him to go and explore and figure out what works the best. But at which point does he no longer visualize the movement of his body and it's just visualizing the movement of the cursor? Yeah. How quickly does it get there? So this happened on a Tuesday. clearly because at some point during the during the day it looked like he wasn't doing super well, it looked like the model wasn't performing super well and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>Nolan is a participant using a Neurlink device to improve his performance in a game called WebGrid, achieving a record of 8.5 BPS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURLINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neurlink is a company developing neural interface technology, which Nolan uses to control a cursor in the game WebGrid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBGRID<|>EVENT<|>WebGrid is a game where participants select targets on a screen, used by Neurlink for research and performance improvement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAIN GAIN<|>EVENT<|>Brain Gain is a clinical trial involving participants who use neural interface technology to advance its development)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>NEURLINK<|>Nolan uses a Neurlink device to control a cursor in the game WebGrid<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>WEBGRID<|>Nolan plays WebGrid to improve his performance and achieve higher BPS<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURLINK<|>WEBGRID<|>Neurlink uses WebGrid as part of their research to improve neural interface technology<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>BRAIN GAIN<|>Nolan is a participant in the Brain Gain clinical trial<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
