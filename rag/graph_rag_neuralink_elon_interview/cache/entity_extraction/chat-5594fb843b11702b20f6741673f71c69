So you're imagining yourself moving each individual finger one at a time and then seeing like, you can notice something. And then when you did the index finger, you're like, oh. Yeah, I was, I was wiggling kind of all of my fingers to see if anything would happen. There was a lot of other things going on, but that big yellow spike was the one that stood out to me. Like I'm sure that if I would have stared at it long enough, I could have mapped out maybe a hundred different things, but the big yellow spike was the one that I noticed. Maybe you could speak to what it's like to sort of wiggle your fingers to like to imagine that The that the mental the cognitive effort required to sort of wiggle your index finger for example How easy is that to do pretty easy for me? It's something that at the very beginning after my accident they told me to try and move my body as much as possible, even if you know you can't just keep trying because that's going to create new like neural pathways or pathways on my spinal cord to like reconnect these things, to hopefully regain some movement someday. That's fascinating. Yeah, I know it's bizarre, but I... So that's part of the recovery process is to keep trying to move your body. Yep. And that's... And the nervous system does its thing. It starts reconnecting. It'll start reconnecting. For some people, it never works. Some people, they'll do it. Like for me, I got some bicep control back, and that's about it. I can if I try enough I can wiggle some of my fingers not like on command it's more like if I try to move say my right pinky and I just keep trying to move it after a few seconds it'll wiggle so I know there's stuff there like I know like and that happens with you know a few different of my fingers and stuff. But yeah, that's what they tell you to do. One of the people at the time, when I was in the hospital, came in and told me, for one guy who had recovered most of his control, what he thought about every day, was actually walking, like the act of walking, just over and over again. So I try that for years. I try just imagining walking, which is it's hard. It's hard to imagine like all of the steps that go into, well, taking a step, like all of the things that have to move, like all the activations that have to happen along your leg in order for one step to occur. But you're not just imagining you're like doing it, right? I'm trying, yeah. So it's like, it's imagining over again what I had to do to take a step. Because it's not something any of us think about. We just, you want to walk and you take a step. You don't think about all of the different things that are going on in your body. So I had to recreate that in my head as much as I could, and then I practice it over and over and over. So it's not like a third person perspective as a first person perspective you're like it's not like you're imagining yourself walking you're like literally doing this everything all the same stuff as you're walking yeah which which was hard it was hard at the beginning like frustrating hard or like actually cognitively hard like what it was both it was both there's a there's a scene in one of the kill bill movies, actually. Oddly enough, where she is like paralyzed, I don't know from like a drug that was in her system, and then she like finds some way to get into the back of a truck or something, and she stares at her toe and she says, move, like move your big toe. And after, you know, a few seconds on screen she does it and she did that with every one of her like body parts until she can move again I did that for years Just stared at my body and said move your index finger move your big toe Sometimes voicelizing it like out loud sometimes just thinking it. I tried every different way to do this to try to get some movement back. And it's hard because it actually is like taxing, like physically taxing on my body, which is something I would have never expected, because it's not like I'm moving, but it feels like there's a buildup of, I don't know, the only way I can describe it is there are like signals that aren't getting through from my brain down because there's that gap in my spinal cord, so brain down and then from my hand back up to the brain. And so it feels like those signals get stuck in whatever body part that I'm trying to move, and they just build up and build up until they burst. And then once they burst, I get like this really weird sensation of everything sort of like dissipating back out to level, and then I do it again. It's also just like a fatigue thing, like a muscle fatigue, but without actually moving your muscles. It's very, very bizarre. And then, you know, if you try to stare at a body part or think about a body part and move for two, three, four, sometimes eight hours, it's very taxing on your mind. It takes a lot of focus. It was a lot easier at the beginning because I wasn't able to like control a TV in my room or anything. I wasn't able to control any of my environment. So for the first few years, a lot of what I was doing was staring at walls. And so, obviously, I did a lot of what I was doing was staring at walls and so Obviously I did a lot of thinking and I tried to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
