And that scene is then converted to a set of electrical impulses or stimulation pulses that you would activate in your visual cortex through these thin film arrays. And by playing some concert in a concerted kind of orchestra of these stimulation patterns, you can create what's called phosphines, which are these kind of white yellowish thoughts that you can also create by just pressing your eyes, you can actually create those percepts by stimulating the visual cortex. And the name of the game is really have many of those and have those perceps be, the phosphines be as small as possible so that you can start to tell apart, like they're the individual pixels of the screen, right? So if you have many, many of those, you know, potentially you'll be able to, you know, in the long term, be able to actually get naturalistic vision, but in the mid, like short term to maybe midterm, being able to at least be able to have object detection algorithms run on your glasses, the pre-pop processing units, and then being able to at least see the edges of things, so you don't bump into stuff. It's incredible. This is really incredible. So you basically would be adding pixels and your brain would start to figure out what those pixels mean. Yeah. And like with different kinds of a system under signal processing on all fronts. Yeah. The thing that actually, so a couple of things, one is, you know, obviously if you're blind from birth, the way brain works, especially in the early age, neuroplasticity is really nothing other than, you know, kind of your brain and different parts of your brain fighting for the limited territory. Yeah. And, and, I mean, very, very quickly you see cases where, you know, people that are, I mean very, very quickly you see cases where people that are, I mean, you also hear about people who are blind that have heightened sense of hearing or some other senses. And the reason for that is because that cortex that's not used just gets taken over by these different parts of the cortex. So for those types of individuals, I mean, I guess they're going to have to now map some other parts of their senses into what they call vision, but it's gonna be obviously a very, very different conscious experience. So I think that's an interesting caveat. The other thing that also is important to highlight is that we're currently limited by our biology in terms of the wavelength that we can see. There's a very, very small wavelength that is a visible light wavelength that we can see with our eyes, but when you have an external camera with this BCI system, you're not limited to that. You can have infrared, you can have UV, you can have whatever other spectrum that you you want to see. And whether that gets mapped to some sort of weird conscious experience, I've no idea. But when I, you know, oftentimes I talk to people about the goal of Neuralink being going beyond the limits of our biology. That's sort of what I mean. And if you're able to control the kind of raw signal, is that when we use our site, we're getting the photons, and there's not much processing on it. If you're able to control that signal, maybe you can do some kind of processing. Maybe you do object detection ahead of time. Yeah, you're doing some kind of pre-processing, and there's a lot of possibilities to explore that. So it's not just increasing sort of thermermermermermermermermermermermermermermermermermermermerm of the kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind kind the kind the kind of theto explore that. So it's not just an increasing sort of thermal imaging, that kind of stuff, but it's also just doing some kind of interesting processing. Correct. Yeah. I mean my theory of how like visual system works also is that I mean there's just so many things happening in the world and there's a lot of photons that are going into your eye and it's unclear exactly where some of the pre-processing steps are happening but I mean I actually think that just from a fundamental perspective there's just so much the reality that we're in if it's a reality is so there's so much data and I think humans are just unable to actually like eat enough actually to process all that information so there's some sort of filtering that does happen whether that happens in the retina whether that happens in different layers of the visual cortex unclear but like the analogy that I sometimes think about is, you know if your brain is a CCD camera and the, all of the information in the about is, you know, if your brain is a CCD camera and all of the information in the world is a sun, and when you try to actually look at the sun with the CCD camera, it's just going to saturate the sensors, right? Because it's an enormous amount of energy. So what you do is you end up adding these filters, right, to just kind of narrow the information that's coming to you and being captured. And I think, you know, things like our experiences or our, you know, like drugs like prophyl, that like anesthetic drug or, you know, psychedelics, what they're doing is they're kind of swapping out these filters and putting in new ones or removing all their ones and Kind of controlling our conscious experience Yeah, man not to distract from the topic, but I just took a very high dose of ayahuasca in the Amazon jungle So yes, it's a nice way to think about it.
