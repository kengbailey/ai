Got it. So you know, you basically higher BPS the more options that are the more difficult to task. And there's also like Zen mode you've played in before which is like infinite. Yeah. It covers it covers the whole screen with a grid and I don't know. What? Yeah. And so you can go like, that's insane. Yeah. He doesn't like it because it didn't show BPS. So like, you know, oh yeah. I have them put in a giant BPS in the background. So now it's like the opposite of Zen mode. It's like super hard mode, like just metal mode if it's just like a giant number in the back count. We should name that. Metal mode is a much better name that. So you also play Civilization 6. I love Civ6, yeah. Usually go with Korea. I do. So the great part about Korea is they focus on like science, tech victories, which was not planned. Like I've been playing Korea for years and then all of the nerling stuff happened. So it kind of aligns. But what I've noticed with tech victories is if you can just rush tech, rush science, then you can do anything. Like at one point in the game you will be so far ahead of everyone technologically that you will have will be so far ahead of everyone, technologically, that you will have like musket men, infantrymen, planes sometimes, and people will still be fighting with like bows and arrows. And so if you want to win a domination victory, you just get to a certain point with the science and then go and wipe out the rest of the world. Or you can just take science all the way and win that way, and you're going to be so far ahead of everyone because you're producing so much science that it's not even close. I've accidentally won in different ways just by focusing on science. I was, yeah, I like, I was playing only science obviously like just Science all the way just tech and I was trying to get like every tech in the tech you won, you're so diplomatic. I'm like, I don't want to do this. I should have declared war on more people or something. It was terrible, but you don't need like giant civilizations with tech, especially with Korea. You can keep it pretty small. So I generally just get to a certain military unit and put them all around my border to to keep everyone out. And then I will just build up so very isolationist. Nice. Yeah, just work on the science. Yeah, that's it. You're making it sound so fun. It's so much fun. And I also saw Civilization 7 trailer. Oh man, I'm so pumped. And that's probably coming out. Come on. Seven. Hit me up. All alpha, beta tests, whatever. When is it coming on? In 2025. Yeah, yeah, next year, yeah. What other stuff would you like to see improved about the NeuralLink app and just the entire experience? I would like to, like I said, get back to the, like click on demand, like the regular clicks. That would be great. I would like to be able to connect to more devices. thooo. to connect to more devices. Right now it's just the computer. I'd like to be able to use it on my phone or use it on different consoles, different platforms. I'd like to be able to control as much stuff as possible, honestly. Like an optimist robot would be pretty cool. That would be sick if I could control an optimist robot. The Link app itself, it seems like we are getting pretty dialed in to what it might look like down the road. Seems like we've gotten through a lot of what I want from it at least. The only other thing I would say is more control over all the parameters that I can tweak with my like cursor and stuff. There's a lot of things that you know go into how the cursor moves in certain ways and I have I don't know like three or four of those parameters and there might gain and friction. Gain friction yeah and there's maybe double the amount of there might gain and friction and there's maybe double the amount of those with just like velocity and then with the actual dwell cursor so I would like all of it I want as much control over my environment as possible especially like advanced mode you know like in like there's many is usually this basic mode and you're like one of those folks like the I go in power user a tans yeah that's that's what I want I want as much control over this as possible so yeah that's that's really all I can ask for just give me give me everything has speech been useful like just being able to talk also in addition to everything else yeah you mean like while I'm using it? While you're using it like speech to text? Oh yeah. Or do you type or like because there's also a keyboard? Yeah, yeah. So there's a virtual keyboard. That's another thing I would like to work more on is finding some way to type to tip with the cursor. But we've played around with like finger spelling, like sign language finger spelling. And that seems really promising. So I have this thought in my head that it's going to be a very similar learning curve that I had with the cursor where I went from attempted movement to imagine movement at one point. I have a feeling, this is just my intuition, that at some point I'm going to be doing finger spelling and I won't need to actually attempt to finger spell anymore, that I'll just be able to think the like letter that I want and it'll pop up. That will be epic. Yeah. That's challenging. That's hard.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
