Building the technology is described above has been no small feet and there's a bunch of links here that I recommend people click on. We constructed in-house microfabrication capabilities to rapidly produce various iterations of thin film arrays that constitute our electrode threads. We created a custom femto second laser mill manufacture components with micro level precision. I think there's a tweet associated with this. That's a whole thing that we can get into. Yeah this this okay what are we looking at here? This thing this thing. So in lessthan one minute our custom-made femtole second Laser mill cuts this geometry in than the diameter of a red blood cell. The small size allows threats to be inserted with minimal damage to the cortex. Okay, so what's interesting about this geometry? So we'll look at this just geometry of a needle. This is the needle that's engaging with the loops in the thread. So they're the ones that thread the loop and then peel it from the silicon backing and then this is the thing that gets inserted into the tissue and then this pulls out leaving the thread. And this kind of a notch or the shark tooth that we used to call is the thing that actually is grasping the loop and then it's designed in such way such that when you pull out leaves the loop. And the robot is control on this needle. Correct. So this is actually housed in a canula and basically the robot has a lot of the optics that look for where the loop is, there's actually a four or five nanometer light that actually causes the polyimid to fluoresce so that you can locate the location of the loop. So the loop lights up? Yeah, yeah they do. It's a micron precision process. What's interesting about the robot that it takes to do that? That's pretty crazy. That's pretty crazy that robot is able to get this kind of precision. Yeah, our robot is quite heavy, our current version of it. There is, I mean, it's like a giant granite slab that weighs about a ton, because it needs to be sensitive to a vibration, environmental vibration, and then as the head is moving, at the speed that is moving, you know, there's a lot of motion control to make sure that you can achieve that level of precision. A lot of optics that kind of zoom in on that. You know, we're working on next generation of the robot that is lighter, easier to transport. I mean it is a it is a feat to move the robot to be searched. And it's far superior to a human surgeon at this time for this particular task. Absolutely. I mean, let alone you try to actually thread a loop in a sewing kit. I mean, this is like, we're talking like fractions of human hair. These things are, it's not visible. So, continuing the paragraph, we developed novel hardware and software testing systems, such as our accelerated lifetime teasurass and simulated surgery environment, which is pretty cool. To stress test and validate the robustness of our technologies, we performed many rehearsals of our surgeries to refine our procedures and make them second nature. This is pretty cool. We practice surgeries on proxies with all the hardware and instruments needed in our mock or in engineering space. This helps us rapidly test and measurements. So there's like proxies. Yeah, this proxy is super cool actually. So there's a 3D printed skull from the images that is taken at Barrow, as well as this hydrogel mix, you know, sort of synthetic polymer thing that actually mimics the mechanical properties of the brain. It also has vatskosher of the person. So basically what we're talking about here, and there's a lot of work that has gone into making this said proxy, that it's about like finding the right concentration of these different synthetic polymers to get the right set of consistency for the needle dynamics, you know, as they're being inserted. But we practice this surgery with the person, you know, Nolan's basically physiology and brain many, many times prior to actually doing the surgery. So to every, every step. Every step, yeah, like where does someone stand like I mean like what you're looking at is the picture this is in in our office of this kind of corner of the robot engineering space that we you know have created this like mock or our space that looks exactly like what they would experience all the staff would experience during their actual surgery so I mean it's just kind of like any dense rehearsal where you know exactly where you're gonna stand at what point, and you just practice that over and over and over again with an exact anatomy of someone that you're going to surgically. And it got to a point where a lot of our engineers, when we created a craniectomy, they're like, oh, that looks very familiar. We've seen that before. Yeah. And there's wisdom you can gain through doing the same thing over and over and over. It's like, your dreams of sushi kind of thing. Because then, it's like Olympic athletes visualize the Olympics. And then once you actually show up, it feels easy. It feels like any other day. It feels almost boring, winning the gold medal. Because you visualize this so many times, you've practiced this so many times, that nothing about is new. It's boring. You win the gold medal is boring. And the experience they talk about is mostly just relief. Probably that they don't have to visualize it anymore. Yeah, the power of the mind to visualize and where, I mean, there's a whole field that studies where muscle memory lies in cerebellum. Yeah, it's incredible. I think it's a good place to actually ask sort of the big question that people might have is how do we know every aspect of this that you described is safe?
