This is especially true in like in classical music heritage. But that's what I'm wondering, like is it all just entropy? So the... So breaking structure or breaking symmetry is something that human seems to like. Maybe as simple as that. Yeah, and I mean, great artists copy. And they also, you know, knowing which rules to break is the important part. And fundamentally, it must be about the listener of the piece. Which rule is the right one to break? It's about the user, the audience member perceiving that as interesting. What do you think is the meaning of human existence? There's a TV show I really like called The West Wing. And in the West Wing, there's a character, he's the President of the United States, who's having a discussion about the Bible with one of their colleagues. And the colleague says something about, you know, the Bible says X, Y, and Z. And the president says, yeah, but you believe the Bible to be literally true? And the president says, yes, but I also think that neither of us are smart enough to understand it. I think to like the analogy here for the meaning of life is that largely we don't know the right question to ask. And so I think I'm very aligned with sort of the hitchhikers guide the galaxy version of this question, which is basically if we can ask the right questions, it's much more likely we find the meaning of human existence. And so in the short term as a heuristic in the sort of search policy space, we should try to increase the diversity of people asking such questions or generally of consciousness and conscious beings asking such questions. So again, I think I'll take the I don't know card here, but say I do think there are meaningful things we can do that improve the likelihood of answering that question. It's interesting how much value you assign to the task of asking the right questions. That's the, that's the main thing, is the answers, is the questions. This point, by the way, is driven home in a very painful way when you try to communicate with someone who cannot speak. Because a lot of the time, the last thing to go is they have the ability to somehow wiggle a lip or move something that allows able to say yes or no to? Wow, that's powerful. Well, Bliss, thank you for everything you do and thank you for being you and thank you for talking to the. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Bliss Chapman. And now, dear friends, here's Nolan Arbaugh, the first human being to have a neural link device implanted in his brain. You had a diving accident in 2016 that left you paralyzed with no feeling from the shoulders down. How did that accident change your life? There's sort of a freak thing that happened. Imagine you're running into the ocean. Although this is a lake, but you're running into the ocean and you get to about waist high and then you kind of like dive in, take the rest of the plunge under the wave or something. That's what I did, and then I just never came back up. Not sure what happened. I did it running into the water with a couple of guys. And so my idea of what happened is really just that I took like a stray fist, elbow, knee, foot, something to the side of my head. The left side of my head was sore for about a month afterwards. So, must have taken a pretty big knock. And then they both came up and I didn't. And so I was face down in the water for a while. I was conscious. And then eventually just, you know, realized I couldn't hold my breath any longer. And I keep saying, took a big drink. People, I don't know if they like that I say that. It seems like I'm making light of it all, but this is kind of how I am. And I don't know, like, I'm a very relaxed, sort of stress-free person. I rolled with the punches for a lot of this. I kind of took it in stride. It's like, all right, well, what can I do next? How can I improve my life even a little bit? On a day-to-day basis at first, just trying to find some way to heal as much of my body as possible, to try to get healed, to try to get off a ventilator, learn as much as I could so I could somehow survive once I left the hospital. And then, thank God I had like my family around me. If I didn't have my parents, my siblings, then I would have never made it this far. They've done so much for me. More than I can ever think them for, honestly. And a lot of people don't have that. A lot of people in my situation, their families either aren't capable of providing for them or honestly, just don't want to. And so they get placed somewhere and, you know, in some sort of home. So thankfully, I had my family. I have a great group of friends, a great group of buddies from college, who have all rallied around me, and we're all still incredibly close. People always say, you know, if you're lucky, you'll end up with one or two friends from high school that you keep throughout your life. I have about 10, 10 or 12 from high school that have all stuck around and we still get together all of us twice a year. We call it the Spring Series and the fall series. This last one we all did, we dressed up like X-Men, so I did a Professor Xavier, and it was freaking awesome. It was so good.
