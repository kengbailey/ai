And everything that I had done was just a perk. It was something that I got to experience. And I know how amazing it's going to be for everyone to come after me. So, might as well just keep trucking along, you know. That said, you were able to get to work your way up to get the performance back. So this is like going from Rocky 1 to Rocky 2. So when did you first realize that this is possible and would give you sort of the strength of motivation, the determination to do it, to increase back up and beat your previous record? Yeah, it was within a couple weeks. Again, this feels like I'm interviewing an athlete. This is great. I like the thing apparently. The road back was long and hard. Frog of many difficulties. There were dark days. It was a couple weeks, I think, and then there was just a turning point. I think they had switched how they were measuring the neuron spikes in my brain, like the bliss, help me out. Yeah, the way in which we were measuring the behavior of individual neurons. Yeah. So we're switching from sort of individual spike detection to something called spike-power, which, if you watch the previous segments with either me or DJ, you probably have some content. So when they did that, it was kind of like a, you know, light over the head, like light bulb moment, like, oh, this works. And this seems like we can run with this. And I saw the uptake and performance immediately. Like I could feel it when they switched over. I was like, this is better. Like, this is good. Like, everything up till this point for the last few weeks, last like whatever, three or four weeks, because it was before they even told me, like everything before this sucked. Like, let's keep doing what we're doing now. And at that point, it was not like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like'm still only at, like, say, in web grid terms, like four or five BPS compared to my 7.5 before, but I know that if we keep doing this, then, like, I can get back there. And then they gave me the dwell cursor, and the dwell cursor sucked at first. It's not, obviously not what I want, but it gave me a path forward to be able to continue using it and hopefully to continue to help out. And so I just ran with it, never look back. Like I said, I'm just kind of person I roll with the punches anyway. What was the process? What was the feedback loop on the figuring out how to do the spike detection in a way that would actually work well for knowing. Yeah, it's a great question so maybe just describe first how the actual update worked is basically an update to your implant so we just did an over-the-air software update to his implants and what you'd update your Tesla or your iPhone and that that firmer. That firmware change enabled us to record sort of averages of populations nearby an individual electrode. So we have less resolution about which individual neuron is doing one, but we have a broader picture of what's going on nearby and electrode overall. And that feedback, I mean, basically as no one described, it was immediate when we flipped that switch. I think the first day we did that, you had three or four VPS right out of the box. And that was a light ball moment for, okay, this is the right path to go down. And from there, there's a lot of feedback around like how to make this useful for independent use. So what we care about ultimately is that you can use independently to do whatever you want. And to get to that point, it required us to reengineer the UX as you talked about the dwell cursor, to make it something  you're doing multiple clicks and using that to control much more fluidly everything and much more naturally the applications that you're trying to interface with. And most importantly, get that web grid number up. Yes. Yeah. So how is the, on the hover click, do you accidentally click stuff sometimes? Like, what's, how hard is it to avoid accidentally clicking? I have to continuously keep it moving, basically. So like I said, there's a threshold where it will initiate a click. So if I ever drop below that, it'll start and I have 0.3 seconds to move it before it clicks anything. And if I don't want it to ever get there, I just keep it moving at a certain speed and like just constantly like doing circles on screen, moving it back and forth to keep it\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROCKY 1<|>EVENT<|>Rocky 1 is a reference to the first movie in the Rocky film series, symbolizing an initial challenge or struggle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCKY 2<|>EVENT<|>Rocky 2 is a reference to the second movie in the Rocky film series, symbolizing a comeback or improvement after an initial struggle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DJ<|>PERSON<|>DJ is a person mentioned in the context of previous segments related to neuron spike measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a company known for its electric vehicles and technology, mentioned here in the context of over-the-air software updates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPHONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>iPhone is a product by Apple Inc., mentioned here in the context of firmware updates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB GRID<|>EVENT<|>Web grid refers to a performance metric system used to measure progress, mentioned in the context of neuron spike detection and performance improvement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DWELL CURSOR<|>EVENT<|>Dwell cursor is a user interface element that allows for control through hovering, mentioned in the context of improving usability for independent use)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROCKY 1<|>ROCKY 2<|>Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 are related as they both symbolize different stages of overcoming challenges, with Rocky 2 representing improvement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>IPHONE<|>Tesla and iPhone are related as examples of devices that receive over-the-air software updates<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEB GRID<|>DWELL CURSOR<|>Web grid and dwell cursor are related as part of the process to improve usability and performance in the context of neuron spike detection<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
