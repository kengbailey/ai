The same is the stream BCI. So, for example, if you're building a model that's decoding a velocity the left click, for example. These have sort of different tradeoffs of how precise you need to be before it becomes useful to the end user. For velocity, it's okay to be on average correct because the output of the model is integrated through time. So if the user's trying to click at position A and they're currently in the output of the model is on average correct, they can sort of steer it through time with the user control loop in the mix, they can get to the point they want to get to. The same is not true of a click. For a click, you're performing it almost instantly, you're performing it almost instantly, you know, their try and the scale of, you know, their their  They might accidentally close the tab that they're trying to do something and lose all their progress. They might accidentally hit some send button on some text that this only like half composed and reads funny after. So you know, there's different sort of cost functions associated with errors in the space. And part of the UX design is is understanding how to build a solution that is when it's wrong, still useful to the end user. That's so fascinating, that assigning cost to every action when an error occurs. So every action, if an error occurs, has a certain cost. And incorporating that into how you interpret the intention, mapping it to the action, is really important. I didn't quite, until you said it, realize there's a cost to like sending the text early. It's like a very expensive cost. It's super annoying. If you accidentally, like if you're a cursor, imagine if you're a cursor misclicked every once in a while. That's like super obnoxious. when the user is trying to click, they're also holding still because they're over the target they want to hit and they're getting ready to click, which means that in the data sets that we build, on average is the case that sort of low speeds or desire to hold still still as correlated with when the user. Wow, that is really fascinating. It's also not the case. People the user. And there's ways to solve this. I mean, you can sort of take the compound approach of, well, let's just give the, like, let's take five seconds to click. Let's just a huge window of theat. thee, the thau-n't the to to  of high bar, then you really want to solve the underlying problem. So maybe this is a good place to ask about how to measure performance, this whole bits per second. What can you like explain what you mean by that? Maybe a good place to start is to talk about web grid as a game as a good illustration of the measurement of performance? Yeah, maybe I'll take one zoom out step there, which is just explaining why we care to measure this at all. So again, our goal is to provide the user the ability to control the computer as well as I can, and hopefully better. And that means that they can do it at the same speed as what I can do with my muscles. And that's a high bar. And so we intend to measure and quantify every aspect of that to understand how we're progressing towards that goal. There's many ways to measure BPS by the the togu. But we present the the the the the the the targets that are on the screen, the smaller they are, the more information you present per click. And so if you think about it from information theory point of view, you can communicate across different information theoretic channels, and one such channel is a typi. their own the te. their the screen. And bits per second is a measure that's computed by taking the log of the number of targets on the screen. You can subtract one if you care to model a keyboard because you have to subtract one for the delete key on the keyboard. But log of the number of targets on the screen times the number of correct selections, thiiii to the standard way to measure a cursor control task in academia. And all credit in the world goes to this great professor, Dr. Shanoi of Stanford, who came up with that task, and he's also one of my inspirations for being in the field. So all the credit in the world to him for coming up with a standardized metric to come up. To facilitate this kind of bragging rights that we have now to say that Nolan no no no no techniques and approaches. How old does this do? So yeah, big kudos to him and to all the team at Stanford. Yeah, so for Nolan and for me playing this task, there's also different modes that you can configure this task. So the web grid task can be presented as just sort of a left click on too. Or you could have targets that you know, the ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta tgets that you just dwell over, or you could have targets that you left, right click, click, you can have targets that are left, right click, middle click, scrolling, clicking and drag it. You can do all sorts of things within this general framework. But the simplest purest form is just blue targets show up on the screen, blue means left. That's the simplest form of the game. academic work and at Neurlink internally with sort of NHPs have all been matched or beaten by Nolan with his Neurlink device. So sort of prior to Neurlink the sort of world record for a human using device is somewhere between 4.2 to 4.6 BPS depending on exactly what paper you read and how you interpret it.
