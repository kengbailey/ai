And you can get this with an able-bodied monkey, a monkey that has a neural device implanted and moving a mouse to control a computer. Even with that ground-truth data set, it turns out that the optimal thing to predict, to produce high-performance BCI, is not just the direct on in the brain and what is the mouse exactly doing on the table. And it turns out that if you build the mapping from neural spikes to predict exactly what the mouse is doing, that model will perform worse than a model that is trained to predict sort of higher level assumptions about what the user might be trying to do. For example, assuming that the monkey is trying to go in a straight line to to the to to the to to the to the the to to the theaee and theae. than actually predicting the underlying hand movement. So the intention, not like the physical movement or whatever. Yeah. There's obviously a very strong correlation between the two, but the intention is a more powerful thing to be chasing. Right. Well, that's also super interesting. I mean, the intention itself is fascinating. Because, yes, with the BCI here in this case, with the digital pathy you're acting on the intention not the action which is why there's an experience of like feeling like it's happening before you meant for it to happen that is so cool and that is why you could achieve like superhuman performance probably in terms of the control of the mouse so the for open loop just to clarify so whenever the person is tasked to like move the mouse to the right, you said there's not feedback. So they don't get to get that satisfaction of like actually getting it to move, right? So you could imagine giving the user feedback on a screen, but it's difficult because at this point you don't know what they're attempting to do. So what can you show them that would basically give them a signal of I'm doing this correctly or not correctly? So let's take this very specific example. Like maybe your calibration task looks like you're trying the right to be over this target. In that kind of scenario, you could imagine coming up with some sort of consistency metric that you could display to the user of, okay, I know what the spike train looks like on average when you do this action to the right. Maybe I can produce some sort of probabilistic estimate trajectory that you that you imagined and I could give the user some sort of feedback of how consistent are they across different trials. You could also imagine that if the user is prompted with that kind of, the user's prompted with that the user's to thea thea. that maybe the user's engaged to begin with because the task showing something on the screen, even if it's not accurate, it's just because it keeps the user motivated to try to increase that number or push it upwards. So there's a psychology element here. Yeah, absolutely. And again, all of that is a UX challenge. How much signal drift is there? Hour to hour, day to day, week, month to month, how often do you have to recalibrate because of the signal drift? Yeah. So this is a problem we've worked on both with NHP, non-human primates, before our clinical trial and then also with Nolan during the clinical trial. Maybe the first thing that's worth stating is what the goal is here. So the goal is user to have a plug and play experience where, I guess they don't have to plug anything in, but a play experience, where they can use the device whenever they want to, however they want to. And that's really what we're aiming for. And so there can be a set of solutions that get to that state without considering this non-stationarity problem. So maybe the first solution here that they can recalibrate whenever they want. This is something that Nolan has the ability to do today, so he can recalibate the system at 2 a.m. in the middle of the night without his caretaker, or parents, or friends around to help push a button for him. The other important part of the solution is that when you have a good model, calibrated, that you can continue using that without need a to do to do to do, to do, to do, to do this recalibration today depends really on his appetite for performance. There are, we observe a sort of a degradation through time of how well any individual model works, but this can be mitigated behaviorally by the user adapting their control strategy. It can also be mitigated through a combination of sort of software features that we provide to the user. For example, we let the user adjust exactly how fast the cursor is moving. We call that the gain, for example, the gain of how fast the cursor reacts to any given input intention. They can also adjust the smoothing, how smooth the output of that cursor intention actually is. They can also adjust the friction, which is how easy it's it to stop and hold still. And all these software tools allow the user a great deal of flexibility and troubles shooting shooting mechanisms to be able to solve this problem for them. By the way, all of this is done by looking to the right side of the screen, selecting the mixer, and the mixer you have, it's like DJ mode. DJ mode for your BCAC. So, I mean, it's a really well done interface. It's really, really really well done. And so, yeah, there's that bias that there's a cursor drift that Nolan talked about in a stream. Although he said that you guys were just playing around with it with him and they're constantly improving, so that could have been just a snapshot of that particular moment a particular day, but he said that there was this cursor drift and this bias that could be removed by him, I guess, looking\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
