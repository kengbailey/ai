How do you test that? Like what's the development environment? Yeah, to simulate that kind of harshness. Yeah, so this is this is where the accelerated life tester essentially is a brain and a vat. It literally is a vessel that is made up of, and again, again, for all intents and purpose for this particular types of tests, your brain is a salt water. And, uh, and you can also put some other tests, your brain is salt water. And you can also put some other set of chemicals like reactive oxygen species that, you know, get at kind of these interfaces and try to cause a reaction to pull it apart. But you could also increase the rate at which these interfaces are aging by just increasing temperature. So every 10 degrees Celsius that you increase, you're basically accelerating time by 2X. And there's limit as to how much temperature you want to increase because at some point there's some other nonlinear dynamics that causes you to have other nasty gases to form that just is not realistic in an environment. So what we do is we increase in our ALT chamber by 20 degrees Celsius that increases the aging by four times. So essentially one day in ALT chamber is four day in calendar year and and we look at whether the implants still are intact, including the threats and operation and all of s. And operation and all of that. And operation and all of that. Obviously it's not an exact same environment as a brain, because you know, brain has mechanical, you know, other more biological groups that attack at it. But it is a good test environment, testing environment for at least the enclosure and the strength of the enclosure. And I mean, we've had implants, the current version of the implant that has been in there for, I mean, close to two and a half years, which is equivalent to a decade, and they seem to be fine. So it's interesting that the brain, so basically, close approximation is warm salt water, hot salt water is a good testing environment. By the way, I'm drinking element, which is basically salt water, which is making me kind of... It doesn't have computational power like the way the brain does, but maybe in terms of other characteristics, is quite similar, and I'm consuming it. Yeah, you have to get it in the right pH too. And then consciousness will emerge. Yeah, no. All right. By the way, the other thing that also is interesting about our enclosure is, if you look at our implant, it's not your common-looking medical implant that usually is a, in case in a titanium can that's laser welded. We use this polymer called PCTFE, polychoro, tri-flora, ethylene, which is actually commonly used in blister packs. So when you have a pill and you try to pop the pill, there's like kind of that plastic membrane, that's what this is. No one's actually ever used this except us. And the reason we wanted to do this is because it's electromagnetically transparent. So when we talked about the electromagnetic inductive charging with titanium can. Usually if you want to do something like that, you know you have to have a sapphire window and it's a very, very tough process to scale. So you're doing a lot of iteration here in every aspect of this, the materials, the software, the whole whole shopping. So okay, so you mentioned scaling. Is it possible to have multiple neuralink devices as one of the ways of scaling? To have multiple neural devices implanted? That's the goal? That's the ways of scaling, to have multiple neural devices implanted. That's the goal. That's the goal. Yeah, we've had, I mean, our monkeys have had two neural links, one in each hemisphere. And then we're also looking at, you know, potential of having one in more cortex, one in visual cortex, and one in wherever other cortex. So focusing on a particular function, one in visual cortex and one in wherever other cortex. So focusing on a particular function, one neural device. I mean I wonder if there's some level of customization that can be done on the compute side. So for the motor cortex? Absolutely. That's the goal. And you know we talk about at neural link building a generalized neural interface to the brain. And and and that also is strategically how we're approaching this with marketing and also with regulatory, which is, hey, look, we have the robot and the robot can access any part of the cortex. Right now we're focused on motor cortex with current version of the N1 that's specialized for motor decoding tasks. But also at the end of the day there's kind of a general compute available there. But you know typically if you want to really get down to kind of hyper-optimizing for power and efficiency you do need to get to some specialized function right. But you know what we're saying is hey you know you are now used to this robotic insertion techniques, which, which took up many, many years of showing data and in conversation with the FDA, and also internally convincing ourselves that this is safe. And now the difference is if we go to other parts of the brain, like visual cortex, which we're interested in as our second product, obviously it's a completely different environment. The cortex is laid out very, very differently. It's going to be more stimulation focus rather than recording, just kind of creating visual percepts. But in the end, we're using the same thin-filum array technology. We're using the same robot insertion technology. We're using the same, you know, packaging technology. Now it's more the conversation is focused around what are the differences and what are the implication of those differences in safety and efficacy.
