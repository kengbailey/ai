Now the cortex is much smarter than the limbic system, and yet is largely in service to the limbic system, it's trying to make the limbic system happy. I mean, the cortex is much smarter than the Olympic system and yet is largely in service to the Olympic system. It's trying to make the Olympic system happy. I mean the sheer amount of compute that's gone into people trying to get laid is insane. Without the, without actually seeking procreation. They're just literally trying to do this sort of simple motion. And they get a kick out of it. So this simple, which in the abstract rather absurd motion, which is sex, the cortex is putting a massive amount of compute into trying to figure out how to do that. So like 90% of distributed compute of the human species is spent on trying to get laid, probably. A massive amount. Yeah. There's no purpose to most sex except hedonistic. You know, it's just sort of a joy or whatever, dopamine release. Now, once in a while it's procreation, but for humans, it's mostly, modern humans, it's mostly recreational. And so, so your cortex, much smarter than your Olympic system, is trying to make Olympic system, is trying to make the Olympic system happy because the Olympic system wanted to have sex. So, or want some tasty food or whatever the case may be. And then that is then further augmented by the tertiary system, which is your phone, your laptop, iPad, whatever, or all your computing stuff. That's your tertiary layer. So you're actually already a cyborg. You have this tertiary compute layer, which is in the form of your computer with all the applications, all your compute devices. And so in the getting laid front, there's actually a massive amount of comp- of digital compute also trying to get laid, you know, with like tender and whatever, you know. Yeah, so the compute that we humans have built is also participating. Yeah, I mean there's like gigawatts of compute going into getting late, of digital compute. Yeah. What if AGI was... This is happening as we speak. If we merge with AI is just going to expand the compute that we humans use. Pretty much. It's one of the things certainly, yeah. Yeah. But what I'm saying is that that yes like what is there a use for humans? Well there's this fundamental question of what's meaning of life why do anything at all? And so if if our simple Olympic system provides a source of will to do something, that then goes to our cortex, that then goes to our tertiary compute layer, then, I don't know, it might actually be that the AI, in a benign scenario is simply trying to make the human limic system happy. Yeah, it seems like the will is not just about the limbic system. There's a lot of interesting complicated things in there. We also want power. That's Olympic too, I think. But then we also want to, in a kind of cooperative way, alleviate the suffering in the world. yeah sure some people do as a group of humans when we get together we start to have this kind of collective intelligence that is is more complex in its will than the underlying individual descendants of apes right so there's like other motivations and that could be a really interesting source of an objective function for AGI yeah I mean there's that  be a really interesting source of an objective function for AGI? Yeah. I mean, there's the, there are these sort of fairly cerebral, or kind of higher level goals. I mean, for me, it's like what's the meaning of life for understanding the nature of the universe is of great interest to me. And hopefully to the AI. And that's the mission of XAI and Grok is Understand the Universe. So do you think people, when you have a neural link with 10,000, 100,000 channels, most of the use cases will be communication with AI systems. damaged neurons in their spinal cord or neck or, you know, as is the case with our first two patients, then, you know, this, obviously, the first-order business is solving fundamental neuron damage in a spinal cord, neck, or in the brain itself. So, you know, and a second product is called blind side, which is to enable people who are completely blind, bless both eyes, or optic nerve, or just can't see it all, to be able to see by directly triggering the neurons in the visual cortex. So we're just starting at the basics here, you know, this is like very, the simple stuff, relatively speaking, is solving neuron damage. You can also solve, I think probably schizophrenia, you know, if people have seizures or some kind, it could probably solve that. It could help with memory. So there's like a, kind of a tech tree, if you will. Like you got the basics. Like you need literacy before you can have, you know, Lord of the Rings. You know. Got it. Do you have letters and alphabet? Okay, great. Words, you know, eventually you get sagas. So, you know, I think there's that there may be some, you know, things to worry about in the future, but the first several years are really just solving basic neurological damage. Like, for people who have essentially complete or near complete loss of from the brain to the body, like Stephen Hawking would be an example, the neural links would be incredibly profound because I mean you can imagine if Stephen Halking could communicate as fast as we're communicating, perhaps faster. And that's certainly possible, probable in fact, likely, I'd say.
