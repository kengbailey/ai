Yeah, there's an external charging device. So yeah, the second part of the implant, the threas are the ones, again, just the last three to five millimeters are the ones that are actually penetrating the cortex. The rest of it is, actually most of the volume is occupied by the battery, rechargeable battery. And, you know, it's about a size of a quarter. I actually have a device here, if you wanna take a look at it. You know, this is the flexible threat component of it, and then this is the implant. So it's about a size of a US quarter. It's about 9 millimeter thick. So basically, this implant, you know, once you have the craniectomy and the threat and the threats are inserted and the hole that you created, this craniectomy gets replaced with that. So basically that thing plugs that hole and you can screw in these self-drilling cranial screws to hold it in place. And at the end of the day, once you have the skin flap over, there's only about two to three millimeters that's, you know, obviously transitioning off of the top of the implant to where the screws are, and that's the minor bump that you have. Those threads look tiny. That's incredible. That is really incredible. That is really incredible. And also, you're right, most of the actual volume is the battery. Yeah. This is way smaller than I realized. They are also, the thread themselves are quite strong. They look strong. And the thread themselves also has a very interesting feature at the end of it called the loop and that's the mechanism to which the robot is able to interface and manipulate this tiny hair-like structure. And they're tiny, so what's the width of a thread? Yeah so the width of a thread starts from 16 micron and then tapers out to about 84 micron. So average human hair is about 80 to 100 micron in width. This thing is amazing. This thing is amazing. Yes, most of the volume is occupied by the battery, rechargeable lithium ion cell. And the charging is done through inductive charging, which is actually very commonly, the, the, rechargeable lithium ion cell. And the charging is done through inductive charging, which is actually very commonly used, you know, your cell phone, most cell phones have that. The biggest difference is that, you know, for us, you know, usually when you have a phone and you want to charge it on a charging pad, you don't really care how hot it gets. Whereas, and for us, it matters. There's a very strict regulation and good reasons to not actually increase the surrounding tissue temperature by 2 degrees Celsius. So there's actually a lot of innovation that is packed into this to allow charging of this implant without causing that temperature threshold to reach. And even small things like you see this charging coil and what's called a ferrite shield, right? So without that ferret shiold, what you end up having when you have, you know, resonant inductive charging is that the battery itself is a metallic can and you form these edic currents from external charger and that causes heating and that actually contributes to inefficiency and charging. So this ferrite shield what it does is that it actually concentrate that field line away from the battery and then around the coil that's actually wrapped around it. There's a lot of really fascinating design here to make it, I mean, you're integrating a computer into a biological, a complex biological system. Yeah, there's a lot of innovation here. I would say that part of what enabled this was just the innovations in the wearable. There's a lot of really, really powerful, tiny, low-power, microcontrollers, temperature sensors, or various different sensors, and power electronics. A lot of innovation really came in, the charging coil design, how this is package, and how do you enable charging charging such that you don't really exceed that temperature limit, which is not a constraint for other devices out there. So let's talk about the threads themselves, those tiny, tiny, tiny things. So how many of them are there? You mentioned a thousand electrodes. How many threads are there? What do the electrodes have to do with the thread? Yeah, so the current instantiation of the device has 64 threads and each thread has 16 electrodes for a total of 1,024 electrodes that are capable of both recording and stimulating. And the thread is basically this polymer insulated wire The metal conductor is the kind of a tyramisu cake of Thai platyte, tie their very very tiny wires, two micron in width so to one millionth of meter It's crazy that that thing I'm looking at has the polymer insulation has the conducting material and has 16 Electros at the end of it on each of those thread. Yeah, and each of those threads correct 16 each one of those Yes, you're not going to be able to see it with naked eyes and I mean to state the, or maybe for people who are just listening, they're flexible. Yes, yes. That's also one element that was incredibly important for us. So each of these thread are, as I mentioned, 16 micron in width and then they tapered to 84 micron, but in thickness they're less than 5 micron. And in thickness is mostly, you know, polyimid at the bottom the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THRASS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thrass is an organization involved in the development and processing of advanced signal processing technologies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTERNAL CHARGING DEVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An external device used for charging implants, likely developed by Thrass)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPLANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medical device developed by Thrass, which includes a rechargeable battery and threads that penetrate the cortex)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US QUARTER<|>GEO<|>A coin used as a size reference for the implant, which is about the size of a US quarter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANIUM<|>GEO<|>The part of the skull where the implant is inserted after a craniectomy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANIAL SCREWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Self-drilling screws used to hold the implant in place within the cranium)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A component of the implant, which is a flexible, polymer-insulated wire with electrodes for recording and stimulating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rechargeable lithium-ion cell that occupies most of the volume of the implant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDUCTIVE CHARGING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A method used to charge the implant's battery without causing significant temperature increase)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FERRITE SHIELD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A component that concentrates the field lines away from the battery to prevent heating during inductive charging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROCONTROLLERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tiny, low-power controllers integrated into the implant for various functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPERATURE SENSORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sensors integrated into the implant to monitor and regulate temperature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Components at the end of each thread, capable of both recording and stimulating)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THRASS<|>EXTERNAL CHARGING DEVICE<|>Thrass developed the external charging device for the implant<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THRASS<|>IMPLANT<|>Thrass developed the implant<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>US QUARTER<|>The implant is about the size of a US quarter<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>CRANIUM<|>The implant is inserted into the cranium after a craniectomy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>CRANIAL SCREWS<|>Cranial screws are used to hold the implant in place<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>THREAD<|>The implant includes threads that penetrate the cortex<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>BATTERY<|>The implant contains a rechargeable lithium-ion battery<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>INDUCTIVE CHARGING<|>The implant's battery is charged through inductive charging<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDUCTIVE CHARGING<|>FERRITE SHIELD<|>The ferrite shield is used to prevent heating during inductive charging<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>MICROCONTROLLERS<|>The implant integrates microcontrollers for various functions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPLANT<|>TEMPERATURE SENSORS<|>The implant includes temperature sensors to monitor and regulate temperature<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THREAD<|>ELECTRODES<|>Each thread has electrodes capable of recording and stimulating<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
