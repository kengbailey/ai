So, you know, so it's not, like, you know, look on the right side, it's a 80 percent likely to be great. So, but I think AI risk mitigation is important. Being a multi-planned species would be a massive risk mitigation. And I do want to sort of, once again, emphasize the importance of having enough children to sustain our numbers and not go in, not plummet into population collapse, which is currently happening. Population collapse is a real and current thing. So the only reason it's not being reflected in the total population numbers is that as much, is because people are living longer. But it's easy to predict, say, what the population of any given country will be. You just take the birth rate last year, how many babies were born, multiply that by life expectancy, and that's what the population will be a steady state unless, if the birth rate continues to that level. But if it keeps declining, it will be even less and eventually dwindled to nothing. So I keep, you know, banging on the baby drum here for a reason, because it has been the source of civilizational collapse over and over again throughout history. And so why don't we just not try to stave off that day? Well in that way I have miserably failed civilization and I'm trying, hoping to fix that day. Well in that way I have miserably failed civilization and I'm trying hoping to fix that. I would love to have many kids. Great, hope you do. No time like the present. Yeah, I got to allocate more compute to the whole process. But apparently it's not that difficult. No, it's like unskilled ever. Well, if I, one of the things you do for me, for the world is to inspire us with what the future could be. And so some of the things we've talked about, some of the things you're building, alleviating human suffering with neural link and expanding the capabilities of the human mind, trying to build the colony on Mars, so creating a backup for humanity on another planet, and exploring the possibilities of what artificial intelligence could be in this world, especially in the real world AI with hundreds of millions, maybe billions of robots walking around. There will be billions of robots  That seems almost, that seems virtual certainty. Well, thank you for building the future and thank you for inspiring so many of us to keep building and creating cool stuff, including kids. You're welcome. Go forth and multiply. Go forth and multiply. Thank you, Yola. Thank you, Yilan. Thanks for talking about it. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Elon Musk. And now, dear friends, here's D.J. Saw, the co-founder, president, and CEO of Nearlink. When did you first become fascinated by the human brain? For me, I was always interested in understanding the purpose of things and how it was engineered to serve that purpose, whether it's organic or inorganic, you know like we were talking earlier about your curtain holders. They serve a clear purpose and they were engineered with that purpose in mind. And growing up, I had a lot of interest in seeing things, touching things, feeling things, and trying to really understand the root of how it was designed to serve that purpose. And obviously, brain is just a fascinating organ that we all carry. It's an infinitely powerful machine that has intelligence and cognition that arise from it. And, you know, we haven't even scratched the surface in terms of how all of that occurs. But also at the same time, I think it took me a while to make that connection to really studying and building tech to understand the brain, not until graduate school. You know, there were a couple moments, key moments in my life where some of those, I think, influence how the trajectory of my life got me to studying what I'm doing right now. One was growing up both sides of my family, my grandparents, had a very severe form of Alzheimer. And it's incredibly debilitating conditions. I mean, literally you're seeing someone's whole identity and their mind just losing over time. And I just remember thinking how both the power of the mind but also how something like that could really the power of the mind but also how something like that could really lose your sense of identity. It's fascinating that that is one of the ways to reveal the power of a thing by watching it lose the power. Yeah a lot of what we know about the brain actually comes from these cases where there are trauma to the brain or some parts of the brain that led someone to lose certain abilities and as a result there's some correlation and understanding of that part of the tissue being critical for that function. And it's an incredibly fragile organ if you think about it that way but also it's incredibly plastic and incredibly resilient in many different ways. And by the way, the term plastic is we'll use a bunch means that it's adaptable. So neuroplasticity refers to the adaptability of the human brain. Correct. Another key moment that sort of influence how the trajectory of my life have shaped towards the current focus of my life has been during my teenageage that th.. th. th. th. th. th. the th. th. the trajectory of my life have shaped towards the current focus of my life has been during my teenage year when I came to the U.S. You know, I didn't speak a word of English. There was a huge language barrier and there was a lot of struggle to kind of connect with my peers around me because I didn't understand the artificial construct that we have created called language, specifically English in this case. And I remember feeling pretty isolated, not being able to connect with peers around me. So I spent a lot of time just on my own\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELON MUSK<|>PERSON<|>Elon Musk is a prominent entrepreneur and CEO known for his work in various fields including space exploration, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a neurotechnology company co-founded by Elon Musk, focused on developing implantable brain–machine interfaces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARS<|>GEO<|>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and Elon Musk aims to build a human colony there as a backup for humanity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DJ SAW<|>PERSON<|>DJ Saw is the co-founder, president, and CEO of Nearlink, and has a deep interest in understanding the human brain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEARLINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nearlink is a company focused on understanding and building technology related to the human brain, co-founded by DJ Saw)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALZHEIMER<|>EVENT<|>Alzheimer's disease is a severe and debilitating condition that affects memory and cognitive function, mentioned as a key influence in DJ Saw's life)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELON MUSK<|>NEURALINK<|>Elon Musk is a co-founder of Neuralink, which aims to alleviate human suffering and expand human capabilities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELON MUSK<|>MARS<|>Elon Musk is working on building a human colony on Mars as a backup for humanity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DJ SAW<|>NEARLINK<|>DJ Saw is the co-founder, president, and CEO of Nearlink<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DJ SAW<|>ALZHEIMER<|>DJ Saw's interest in the human brain was influenced by his grandparents' severe form of Alzheimer<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
