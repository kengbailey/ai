I guess I should step back and say the initial goal of the project was to build these tiny About a size of a neuron implantable system that can be parked next to a neuron being able to record its state and being able to Ping that back to the outside world for doing something useful, and as I mentioned, the size of the Implantable system is limited by how you power the thing and get the data off of it. And at the end of the day, fundamentally, if you look at a human body, we're essentially a bag of salt water with some interesting proteins and chemicals, but it's mostly salt water that's very, very well temperature regulated at 37 degrees Celsius. And we'll get into how why, and later, why that's that's very, very well temperature regulated at 37 degrees Celsius. And we'll get into how why and later why that's an extremely harsh environment for any electronics to survive as I'm sure you've experienced or maybe not experienced you know dropping cell phone in a salt water in an ocean it will instantly kill the device right? But anyways, just in general, electromagnetic waves don't penetrate through this environment well. And just the speed of light, it is what it is. We can't change it. And based on the wavelength at which you are interfacing with the device, the device just needs to be big. Like these inductors needs to be quite big. And the general good rule of thumb is that you want the wavefront to be roughly on the order of the size of the thing that you're interfacing with. So an implantable system that is around 10 to 100 micron in dimension, in a volume, which is about the size of a neuron that you see in a human body. You would have to operate at like hundreds of gigahertz, which, number one, not only is it difficult to build electronics operating at those frequencies, but also the body just attenuates that very, very significantly. So the interesting kind of insight of this ultrasound was the fact that ultrasound just travels a lot more effectively in the human body tissue compared to electromagnetic waves. And this is something that you encounter, and I'm sure most people have encountered in their lives, when you go to you know hospitals that are medical ultrasound you know sonograph right and they go into very very deep death without attenuating too much too much of the signal so all in all you know ultrasound the fact that it travels through the body extremely well and the mechanism to which it travels through the body extremely well, and the mechanism to which it travels to the body really well is that just the wavefront is very different. It's electromagnetic waves are transfers, whereas in ultrasound waves are compressive. So it's just a completely different mode of wavefront propagation. And as well as speed of sound is orders and orders of magnitude less than speed of light, which means that even at 10 megahertz ultrasound wave, your wavefront ultimately is a very, very small wavelength. So if you're talking about interfacing with the 10 micron or 100 micron type structure, you would have 150 micron wavefront at 10 megahertz and building electronics at those frequencies are much, much easier and they're a lot more efficient. So the basic idea kind of was born out of using ultrasound as a mechanism for powering the device and then also getting data back. So now the question is how do you get the data back-scatting. The mechanism to which we landed on is what's called backscattering. This is actually something that is very common and that we interface on a day-to-day basis with our RFID cards, you know, a radio frequency ID tax, where there's actually rarely, you know, in your ID, a battery inside. There's an antenna and there's some sort of coil that has your serial identification ID. And then there's an external device called a reader that then sends a wavefront, and then you reflect back that wavefront with some sort of modulation that's unique to your ID. That's what's called backscattering fundamentally. So the tag itself actually doesn't have to consume that much energy and that was a mechanism to which we were kind of thinking about sending the data back. So when you have an external ultrasonic transducer that's sending ultrasonic wave to your implant, the neural dust implant, and it records some information about its environment, whether it's a neuron firing or some other state of the tissue that is interfacing with, and then it just amplitude modulates the wavefront that comes back to the source. And the recording step would be the only one that is interfacing with, and then it just amplitude modulates the wavefront that comes back to the source. And the recording step would be the only one that requires any energy? So what would require energy in that little step? Correct. So it is that initial kind of start up circuitry to get that recording, amplifying it, and then just modulating. And the mechanism to which that you can enable that is there is this specialized crystal called piezoelectric crystals that are able to convert sound energy into electrical energy and vice versa. So you can kind of have this interplay between the ultrasonic domain and electrical domain that is the biological tissue. So on the theme of parking very small computational devices next to neurons, that's the dream, the vision of brain computer interfaces. Maybe before we talk about Neural and can you give a sense of the history of the field of BCI? What has been maybe the continued dream and also some of the milestones along the way of the different approaches and the amazing work done at the various labs. I think a good starting point is going back to 1790s. I did not expect that.
