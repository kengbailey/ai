There's, I mean, similar to dark energy and dark matter, there's dark neurons. What are they all doing? When you place these electrode, again, like, within this hundred micron volume, you have 40 neurons, why do you not see only a handful? What's happening there? Well, they're mostly quiet, but like when they speak, they say profound shit, I think. That's the way I'd like to think about it. Anyway, before we zoom in even more, let's zoom out. So, how does Neuralink work? the surgery to the implant, to the signal and the decoding process, and the human being able to use the implant to actually affect the world outside. And all of this I'm asking in the context of there's a gigantic historic milestone the Neurolink just accomplished in January of this year putting a Neurlink implant and the first human being Noland. And there's been a lot to talk about there about his experience because he's able to describe all the nuance and the beauty and the fascinating complexity of that experience of everything involved. But on the technical level, how does neural link work? Yeah, so there are three major components to the technology that we're building. One is the device, the thing that's actually recording these neural chatters. We call it N1 implant or the link. And we have a surgical robot that's actually doing an implantation of these tiny, tiny wires that we call threads that are smaller than human hair. And once everything is surgiarized, you have these neural signals, these spiking neurons that are coming out of the brain, and you need to have some sort of software to decode what the user's intent to do with that. So there's what's called the NeuralLink application or B1 app that's doing that translation is running the very, very simple machine learning model that decodes these inputs that are neural signals and then converted to a set of outputs that allows you know our participant first participant Nolan to be able to control a cursor on this and this is done wirelessly and this is done wirelessly so we are our implant is actually two-part that the link has you know these flexible tiny wires called threads that have multiple electrodes along its length and they're only inserted into the cortical layer which is about three to five millimeters in a human brain in the motor cortex region that's where the kind of the intention for movement lies in. And we have 64 of these threads, each thread having 16 electrodes along, you know, the span of 3 to 4 millimeters, separated by 200 microns. So you can actually record along the death of the insertion. And based on that signal, there's custom, you know, integrated circuit or ASIC that we built that amplifies the neural signals that you're recording and then digitizing it and then has some mechanism for detecting whether there was an interesting event that is a spiking event and decide to send that or not send that through Bluetooth to an external device, whether it's a phone or a computer that's running this neural application. So there's on-board signal processing already just to decide whether this is an interesting event or not. So there is some computational power on board inside the in addition to the human frame. Yeah, so it does the signal processing to kind of really compress the amount of signal that you're recording. So we have a total of thousand electrodes sampling at, you know, just under 20 kilherts with 10 bit each. So that's 200 megabits that's coming through to the chip from thousand channel simultaneous neural recording. And that's quite channel simultaneous neural recording. And that's quite a bit of data. And there are technology available to send that off wirelessly, but being able to do that in a very, very thermally constrained environment that is a brain. So there has to be some amount of compression that happens to send off only the interesting data that you need, which in this particular case for motor decoding is occurrence of a spike or not, and then being able to use that to to decode the intended cursor movement. So the implant itself processes it, figures out whether a spike happened or not with our spike detection algorithm and then sends it off, packages it, send it off through Bluetooth to an external device that then has the model to decode okay based on the spiking inputs. Did Nolan wish to go up, down, left, right, or click or whatever? All of this is really fascinating but let's stick on the N1 implant itself. So the thing that's in the brain, so I'm looking at a picture of it. There's an enclosure. There's a charging call, so we didn't talk about the charging, which is fascinating. The battery, the power electronics, the antenna. Then there's the signal processing electronics. I wonder if there's more kinds of signal processing you can do it. That's another question. And then there's the threads themselves with the enclosure on the bottom. So maybe to ask about the charging. So there's an external charging device. Yeah, there's an external charging device. So yeah, the second part of the implant, the threass the the the the the the the thr-trines signal-the ones the the the the the the thrass the the the thrass the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the thing processing processing thrass signal signal signal signal signal signal signal thrass signal signal signal signal thro processing thro processing are the the the signal signal signal signal signal signal signal the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the th signal signal signal signal signal the the the the device.
