The cortex is laid out very, very differently. It's going to be more stimulation focus rather than recording, just kind of creating visual percepts. But in the end, we're using the same thin-filum array technology. We're using the same robot insertion technology. We're using the same, you know, packaging technology. Now it's more the conversation is focused around what are the differences and what are the implication of those differences in safety and efficacy. The way said second product is both hilarious and awesome to me. That product being restoring sight for blind people. So can you speak to stimulating the visual cortex? I mean the the possibilities there are just incredible to be able to give that gift back to people who don't have sight or even any aspect of that. Can you just speak to the challenges of the, that gift back to people who don't have sight, or even any aspect of that. Can you just speak to the challenges of, there's several challenges here, one of which is, like you said, from recording to the stimulation. Just any aspect of that, that you're both excited and see the challenges of. Yeah, I guess I'll start by saying that we actually have been capable of stimulating through our tent film array as well as other electronics for years. You know, we have actually demonstrated some of that capabilities for reanimating the limb in the spinal cord. Obviously for the current EFS study, we've hardware disabled that, so that's something that we wanted to embark as a separate journey. And obviously there are many, many different ways to write information into the brain. The way in which we're doing that is through electrical, you know, passing electrical current and kind of causing that to really change the local environment so that you can sort of artificially cause kind of the neurons to depolarize in nearby areas. For vision specifically, you know, the way our visual system works, it's both well understood. I mean, anything with kind of brain, there are aspects of it that's well understood, but in the end, like we don't really know anything. But the way visual system works is that you have photon hitting your eye, and in your eyes, you know, there are these specialized cells called photoreceptor cells that convert the photon energy into electrical signals, and then they get, that convert the photon energy into electrical signals and then they get that then gets projected to your back up your head, your visual cortex. You know it goes through actually a you know thalemic system called LGN that then projects it out and then in the visual cortex there's you know visual area one or V1 and thenthere's a bunch of other higher level processing layers like V2, V3. And there are actually kind of interesting parallels. And when you study the behaviors of these convolutional neural networks, like what the different layers of the network is detecting. You know, first they're detecting like these edges, and they'rethen detecting some more natural curves and then they start to detect like objects right? Kind of similar thing happens in the brain and a lot of that has been inspired and also it's been kind of exciting to see some of the correlations there. But you know things like from there where this cognition arise and where is color encoded, there's just not a lot of understanding, fundamental understanding there. So in terms of kind of bringing sight back to those that are blind, there are many different forms of blindness. There's actually a million people, one million people in the US that are legally blind. That means like certain, like score below in kind of the visual test. I think it's something like if you can see something at 20 feet distance that normal people can see at 200 feet distance like you're like if you're worse than that you're legally blind. So for the fundamental that means you can't function effectively using site in the world. Yeah, like to navigate your environment. And yeah there are different forms of blindness. There are forms of blindness where there's some degeneration of your retina, his photoreceptor cells, and rest of your visual you know processing that I described is intact. And for those types of individuals, you may not need to maybe stick electrodes into the visual cortex. You can actually build retinal prosthetic devices that actually just replaces a function of that retinal cells that are degenerated and there are many companies that are working on that, but that's a very small slice. I'll be a significant still slice of folks that are degenerated and there are many companies that are working on that. But that's a very small slice. I'll be a significance, the smaller slice of folks that are legally blind. You know, if there's any damage along that circuitry, whether it's in the optic nerve or, you know, just the LGN circuitry or any break in that circuit, that's not going to work for you. And the source of where you need to actually cause that's not going to work for you. And the source of where you need to actually cause that visual percept to happen because your biological mechanism is not doing that is by placing electrodes in the visual cortex in the back of your head. And the way in which this would work is that you would have an external camera, whether it's something as unsophisticated as a GoPro, or some sort of wearable ray band type glasses that Meta is working on, that captures a scene, right? And that scene is then converted to a set of electrical impulses or stimulation pulses that you would activate in your visual cortex through these thin film arrays. And by playing some concert in a concerted kind of orchestra of these stimulation patterns, you can create what's called phosphines, which are these kind of white yellowish thoughts that you can also create by just pressing your eyes, you can actually\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
