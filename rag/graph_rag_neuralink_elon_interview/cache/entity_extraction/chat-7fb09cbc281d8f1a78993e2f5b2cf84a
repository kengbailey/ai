Right, yeah, it's basically, you can imagine it's a stylus that you hold between your teeth. Yeah, it's basically a very long stylus. And it's exhausting, it hurts, and it's inefficient. Yeah, and maybe it's also worth calling out, there are other alternative assisted technologies, but that particular situation, Nolan's in, and this is not on common, and I think it's also not well understood by folks, is that, you know, he's relatively spastic, so he'll have muscle spasms from time to time. And so any assistive technology that requires him to be positioned directly in front of a camera, for example, an eye tracker, or anything that requires him to put something in his mouth, the trace to PCI's just as a to to to to to to to the to to face if these spasms too hard. So these kind of considerations are important when thinking about what advantages the PCI has in someone's life. If it fits ergonomically into your life in a way that you can use it independently when your caretaker is not there, wherever you want to, either in the bed or in the chair, depending on your comfort level and your desire to have pressure so, you know, all these matter a lot in how good the solution is in that user's life. So one of these very fun examples is scroll. So again, manga is something he wanted to be able to read. And there's many ways to do scroll with the BCI. You can imagine like different gestures, for example, the user could do that would move the page. But scroll is a very fascinating control surface because it's a huge thing on the screen in front of you. So any sort of jitter in the model output, any sort of air in the model output causes like an earthquake on the screen. Like you really don't want to have your mangopage that you're trying to read be shifted up and down a few pixels just because you know your scroll decoder is not completely accurate. And so this was an example where we had to figure out how to formulate the problem in a way that the errors of the system, whenever they do occur, and we'll do our best to minimize them, but whenever those errors do occur, that it doesn't interrupt the qualia, again, of the experience that the user is having, it doesn't interrupt the flow of reading their book. And so what we ended up building is this really brilliant work called Quick Scroll. And Quick Scroll basically looks at the screen and it identifies where on the screen are scroll bars. And it does us by deeply integrating with Mac OS to understand where are the scroll bars actively present on the screen using the sort of accessibility tree that's available to MacLess apps. And we identified where those scroll bars are and we provided a BCI scroll bar. And the BCI scroll bar looks similar to a normal scroll bar, but it behaves very differently and that once you sort of move over to it, your cursor sort of morphs onto it, it sort of attaches or latches onto it. And then once you push up or down in the same way that you would use a push to control the normal cursor, it actually moves the screen for you. So it's basically like remapping the velocity to a scroll action. And the reason that feels so natural and intuitive is that when you move over to attach to it, it feels like magnetic, so you're like sort of stuck onto it, and then it's one continuous action. You don't have to like switch your imagined movement. You sort of snap onto it and the scroll behavior works to make it natural and intuitive. So one example is momentum. Like when you scroll a page with your fingers on the screen, you know, you actually have some like flow, like it doesn't just stop right when you lift your finger up. The same is tr right sort of dynamic or what's the right amount of page give, if you will, when you push it to make it flow the right amount for the user to have a natural experience reading their book. And there's a million, I mean, I can tell you, like, therethat feel extremely natural and easy for the user to navigate. I mean, even the scroll on a smartphone with your finger feels extremely natural and pleasant and it probably takes an extremely long time to get that right. And actually the same kind of visionary UX design that we're talking about. Don't always listen to the users but also listen to them and also have like visionary big like throw everything I'll think from first principles but also not. Yeah, yeah, by the way, it just makes me think that scroll bars on the desktop probably have stagnated and never taken that like, because the snap, same as it's like snap to grid, snap to scroll bar action you're talking about, it's something that could potentially be extremely useful in the desktop setting. Even just for users to just improve the experience. Because the current scroll bar experience in the desktop is horrible. Yeah, it's hard to find, hard to control, there's not a momentum, there's... And the intention should be clear, when I start moving towards a scroll bar, there should be a snapping to the scroll bar action. But of course, you know, maybe I'm okay paying that cost, but there's hundreds of millions of people paying that cost nonstop, but in this case, this is necessary because there's an extra cost paid by Nolan for the jitteriness. So you have to switch between the scrolling and the reading. There has to be a phase shift between the two. Like, when you're scrolling, you're scrolling. Right, right. So that is one drawback of the current approach.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
