So he was actually immediately after the surgery, you know, like an hour after the surgery as he was waking up. We did turn on the device, make sure that we are recording neural signals. And we actually did have a couple signals that we noticed that he can actually modulate. And what I mean by modulate is that he can think about crunching his fist and you could see the spike disappear and appear. That's awesome. And that was immediate, right? How cool is that? How cool is that? Yeah, that's a human being. I. How cool is that? Yeah, that's a human being. I mean, what does that feel like for you? This device and a human being a first step of a gigantic journey. I mean, it's a historic moment. Even just that spike, just to be able to modulate that. You know, obviously there have been other, other, you know, as you mentioned, pioneers that have participated in these groundbreaking BCI, you know, investigational early feasibility studies. So we're obviously standing in the shoulders of the giants here, you know, we're not the first ones to actually put electrodes in a human, human brain. But, I mean, just leading up to the surgery, there was, I definitely could not sleep. There's just, it's the first time that you're working in a completely new environment. We had a lot of confidence based on our bench top testing, or pre-clinical R&D studies that the mechanism, the threads, the insertion, all that stuff is very safe and that it's obviously ready for doing this in a human, but there's still a lot of unknown, unknown about can the needle actually insert? I mean, we brought something like 40 needles just in case they break. And we ended up using only one, but I mean, that was a level of just complete unknown, right, because it's a very, very different environment. And I mean, that's why we do clinical trial in the first place to be able to test these things out. So extreme nervousness and just,, many, many sleepless night leading up to the surgery and definitely the day before the surgery, and it was an early morning surgery, like we started at 7 in the morning, and by the time it was around 1030, it was, it was, everything was done. But, I mean, first time seeing that, well, number one, just huge relief, that this thing is, you know, doing what it's supposed to do. And two, I mean, just immense amount of gratitude for Nolan and his family. And then many others that have applied and that we've spoken to, and we'll speak to, are true pioneers in every war. And I sort of call them the neural astronauts or neural knot. You know, these amazing, just like in the 60s, right? Like these amazing just pioneers, right? Exploring the unknown outwards, in this case, this inward. But an incredible amount of gratitude for them to, you know, just participate and play a part. And it's a journey that we're embarking on together. But also, like I think it was just, that was a very, very important milestone, but our work was just starting. So a lot of just kind of anticipation for, okay, what needs to happen next? What are a set of sequences of events that needs to happen for us to, you know, make it worthwhile for both Nolan as well as us. Just a linger on that, just a huge congratulation to you and the team for that milestone. I know there's a lot of work left, but that is that's really exciting to see. There's a that's a source of hope. It's this first big step opportunity to help hundreds of thousands of people and then maybe expand the realm of the possible for the human mind for millions of people in the future. So it's really exciting. So the opportunities are all ahead of us and to do that safely and to do that effectively was really fun to see. As an engineer, just watching other engineers come together and do an epic thing, that was awesome. So huge, congrats. Thank you. Thank you. It's, yeah, could not have done it without the team. And yeah, I mean, that's the other thing that I, you know, told the team as well, of just this immense sense of optimism for the future. I mean, it was a very important moment for the company, you know, needless to say, as well as, you know, hopefully for many others out there that we can help. So speaking of challenges, NeuralLink published a blog post describing that some of the threads are attracted, and so the performance as measured by bits per second dropped at first, but then eventually it was regained, and that the whole story of how it was regained is super interesting. That's definitely something I'll talk to Bliss and to Nolan about. But in general, can you speak to this whole experience? How was the performance regained and just the technical aspects of the threads being attracted and moving? The main takeaway is that in the end, the performance have come back and it's actually gotten better than it was before. He's actually just beat the world record yet again last week to 8.5, so I mean he's just cranking and he's just improving. The previous world record, in human was 4.6 said 8.5. Yeah, the previous world record in human was 4.6. Yeah. So it's almost double. And his goal is to try to get to 10, which is roughly around kind of the median neurolinker using a, you know, mouse with a hand.
