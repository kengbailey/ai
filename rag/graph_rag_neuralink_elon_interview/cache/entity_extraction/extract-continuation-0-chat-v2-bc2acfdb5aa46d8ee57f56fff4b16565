He's not a complaining person. He says, hey, here's this thing that I've discovered is not optimal in my flow. Here's some ideas how to fix it. Let me know what your thoughts are. Let's figure out how to solve it. And it often happens that those things are addressed within, you know, a couple hours of him giving us his feedback. at the end of the session he's giving us feedback on the next iteration of that of that process or that set up. That's fascinating because one of the things you mentioned that there was 271 pages of notes taken from the BCI sessions and this was just in March. So one of the amazing things about human beings that they can provide especially ones who are smart and excited and all like positive and good vibes like Nolan that they can provide feedback, continuous feedback. Yeah, it also requires just to brag on the team a little bit. I work with a lot of exceptional people. And it requires the team being absolutely laser focused on the user, and what will be the best for them. And it requires like a level of commitment of, okay, this is what the user feedback was. I've all these meetings, we're going to skip thk the and we're going to do this. You know, that level of focus commitment is, I would say, under-appreciated in the world. And also, you know, you obviously have to have the talent to be able to execute on these things effectively. And yeah, we have to, a interesting space of UX design, because you have, there's so many unknowns here. And I can tell UX is difficult because of how many people do it poorly. It's just not a trivial thing. Yeah. It's also, you know, UX is not something that you can always solve by just constant iterating on different things. Like sometimes you really need to step back and think globally, am I even like the right sort of minima to be chasing down for a solution? Like, there's a lot of problems in which sort of fast iteration cycle is the predictor of how successful you can progress. It's just an easier learning problem, the more frequently you get feedback. But UX is not that way. I mean, users are actually quite often wrong about what the right solution is, and it requires a deep understanding of the technical system and what's possible, combined with what the problem is you're trying to solve, that's the old like stories of Steve Jobs like rolling in there like yeah, the user is a good, is a useful signal, but it's not a perfect signal. And sometimes you have to remove the floppy disk drive or whatever the, I forgot all the crazy stories of Steve Jobs, like making wild design decisions. But there, some of it is aesthetic, that some of it is about the love you put into the design, which is very much a Steve Jobs, Johnny Ive type thing. But when you have a human being using their brain to interact with it, there is also deeply about function. It's not just aesthetic. And that you have to empathize with a human being before you while not always listening to them directly. Like you have to deeply empathize. It's fascinating. It's really, really fascinating. And at the same time, iterate, right? But not iterate in a small way sometimes a complete, like rebuilding the design. He said that Nolan said in the early days the UX sucked, but you improved quickly. What was that journey like? Yeah, I mean, I'll give one concrete example. So he really wanted to be able to read manga. This is something that he I mean, yeah, it sounds like a simple thing But it's actually a really big deal for him And he couldn't do it with this mouth stick. It just wasn't accessible That you can't scroll with the mouse stick on his iPad and on the website That he wanted to be able to use the newest manga and so might be a good quick pause to scroll on a tablet. Right, yeah, it's basically, you can imagine it's a stylus that you hold between your teeth. Yeah, it's basically a very long stylus. And it's exhausting, it hurts, and it's inefficient. Yeah, and maybe it's also worth calling out, there are other alternative assisted technologies, but that particular situation, Nolan's in, and this is not on common,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>Nolan is a user who provides continuous feedback on the application, particularly interested in reading manga and using assistive technologies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVE JOBS<|>PERSON<|>Steve Jobs was known for making bold design decisions and emphasizing both aesthetics and functionality in product design)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHNNY IVE<|>PERSON<|>Johnny Ive is a designer known for his work with Steve Jobs, focusing on the love and aesthetics put into design)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BCI SESSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Sessions where 271 pages of notes were taken in March, involving user feedback and iteration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UX DESIGN<|>EVENT<|>The process of designing user experiences, which involves understanding user needs and iterating on designs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>BCI SESSIONS<|>Nolan provided feedback during the BCI sessions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVE JOBS<|>JOHNNY IVE<|>Steve Jobs and Johnny Ive collaborated on product design, focusing on aesthetics and functionality<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>UX DESIGN<|>Nolan's feedback contributed to the UX design process<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
