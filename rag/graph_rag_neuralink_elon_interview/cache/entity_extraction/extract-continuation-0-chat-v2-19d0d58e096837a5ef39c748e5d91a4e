I have a feeling, this is just my intuition, that at some point I'm going to be doing finger spelling and I won't need to actually attempt to finger spell anymore, that I'll just be able to think the like letter that I want and it'll pop up. That will be epic. Yeah. That's challenging. That's hard. That's a lot of work for you to kind of take that leap. But that would be awesome. And then, like, going from letters to words is another step. Like, you would go from, you know, right now it's finger spelling, then it should be able to pick up like the whole sign language, like language. And so then if I could do something along those lines, or just the sign language spelled word, if I can, you know, spell it at a reasonable speed and it can pick that up, then I would just be able to think that through and it would do the same thing. I don't see why not, after what I saw with the with the cursor control, I don't see why it wouldn't work, but we'd have to play around with it more. What was the process in terms of like training yourself to go from attempted movement to imagine movement? How long does that take? So like how long would this kind of process take? Well, it was a couple weeks before it just like happened upon me. But now that I know that that was possible, I think I could make it happen with other things. I think it would be much, much simpler. Would you get an upgraded implant device? Sure, absolutely. Whenever they'll let me. So you don't have any concerns for you with the surge experience, all of it was like no regrets. No. So everything's been good so far. Yep. You just keep getting upgrades. Yeah, I mean, why not? I've seen how much it's impacted my life already. And I know that everything from here on Osh is going to get better and better. So I would love to get the upgrade. What future capabilities are you excited about sort of beyond this kind of telepathy? Is vision interesting? So for folks who, for example, are blind, so in your link enabling people to see or for speech? Yeah, there's a lot that's very, very cool about this. I mean, we're talking about the brain. So there's, like this is just motor cortex stuff. There's so much more that can be done. The vision one is fascinating to me. I think that is going to be very, very cool to give someone the ability to see for the first time in  incredible. The speech thing is really interesting, being able to have some sort of like real-time translation and cut away that language barrier would be really cool. Any sort of like actual impairments that it could solve, like with speech would be very, very cool. And then also there are a lot of different disabilities that all originate in the brain. And you would be able to hopefully be able to solve a lot of those. I know there's already stuff to help people with seizures that can be implanted in the brain. This would do, I imagine the same thing. And so you could do something like that. I know that even someone like Joe Rogan has talked about the possibilities with being able to stimulate the brain in different ways. I'm not sure, I'm not sure what, you know, like how ethical a lot of that would be. That's beyond me, honestly. But I know that there is a lot that can be done when we're talking about the brain and being able to go in and physically make changes to help people or to improve their lives. So I'm really looking forward to everything that comes from this. And I don't think it's all that far off. I think a lot of this can be implemented within my lifetime, assuming that I live a long life. What you were referring to is things like people suffering from depression or things of that nature potentially getting help. Yeah, flip a switch like that, make someone happy. I know, I think Joe has talked about it more in terms of like you want to experience like what a drug trip feels like, like you want to experience like what a drug trip feels like you want to experience what you like to be on course yeah mushrooms or something like that DMT like you can just flip that switch in the brain. My buddy Bain has talked about being able to like wipe parts of your memory and re-experience things that like for the first time like your favorite movie or your favorite book like just wipe that out real quick and then refall in love with Harry Potter or something. I told him I was like I don't know how I feel about like people being able to just wipe parts of your memory. That seems a little sketch to me he's like they're already doing it so. Sounds legit. I would love memory replay just like actually like high-resolution replayable memories. Yeah, I saw an episode of Black Mirror about that once. I don't think I want it. Yeah, so Black Mirror always kind of considers the worst case, which is important. I think people don't consider the best case or the average case enough. I don't know what it is about us humans. We want to think about the worst possible thing. We love drama. It's like how is this new technology going to kill everybody? We just love that. Hopefully people don't think about that too much with me. It'll ruin a lot of my plans. Yeah, I assume you're going to have to take all the world. I mean, I love your Twitter.
