Last week. Yeah. Yeah, we finally got a good training going at a roughly 420 a.m. Last Monday. Total coincidence. Yeah, I mean maybe it was 422 or something. Yeah. It's that universe again with the jokes. Exactly. It just loves it. I mean, I wonder if you could speak to the fact that you, one of the things that you did when I was there is you went through all the steps of what everybody's doing just to get a sense that you, yourself, understand it, and everybody understands it so they can understand when something is dumb. Or something is inefficient or the lack of myself. Can you speak to that? Yeah, so I like I try to do, whatever the people at the front lines are doing, I try to do it at least a few times myself. So connecting fiber optic cables, diagnosing a polyconnection, that tends to be the limiting factor for large training clusters is the cabling. There's so many cables. Because for a coherent training system where you've got RDMA, a remote, direct memory access. The whole thing is like one giant brain. So it's if you've got Any to any connection. So it's the the Any GPU can talk to any GPU out of a hundred thousand That was a crazy cable layout it looks pretty cool. Yeah, it's like it's like the human brain. the human brain. It's like a human brain. It's like a human brain. It's like a massive amount of? It's a massive amount of? It's like the human brain but like at a scale that humans can visibly see. It is a brain. I mean the human brain also has a massive amount of the brain tissue is the cables. Yeah. So they get the gray matter which is the compute and then the white matter which is cables. Big percentage of your brain is just cables. That's what it felt like walking around in the supercomputer center is like we're walking around inside a brain. Yeah, one day build a super intelligent super intelligent system. Do you think? Yeah. You think there's a chance that X AI you are the one that builds AGI? Um, it's possible. What do you define as AGI? I think humans will never acknowledge that AGI has been built-keep moving the goalpost. Yeah. So I think there's already superhuman capabilities that are available in AI systems. I think what AGI is is when it's smarter than the collective intelligence of the entire human species. In our... Well, I think that, yeah, that really people would call that sort of ASI artificial superintelligence. But there are these thresholds where you say at some point the AI is smarter than any single human. And then you've got 8 billion humans. So, and actually each human is machine augmented via the computers. So you've got, so it's a much higher bar to compete with 8 billion machine augmented humans. That's, you know, a whole bunch of orders magnitude more. So, so, but at a certain point, yeah, the AI will be smarter than all humans combined. If you are the one to do it, do you feel the responsibility of that? Yeah. Absolutely. And I want to be clear, like, let's say, if X AI is first the others won't be far behind. I mean that they might be six months behind or a year maybe not even that. So how do you do it in a way that that doesn't hurt humanity do you think? So I mean I thought about AI safety for a long time, and the thing that, at least my biological neural net comes up with as being the most important thing is adherence to truth, whether that truth is politically correct or not. So, I think if you, if you force AIs to lie, you're really asking for trouble. Even if that lie is done with good intentions. So, I mean, you saw sort of issues with chattivity and Gemini and whatnot, like we asked Gemini for an image of the founding parts of the United States, and it chose a group of diverse women. Now that's factually untrue. So now that's sort of like a silly thing, but if an AI is programmed to say like diversity is a necessary output function and then it becomes sort of this omnipowerful intelligence, it could say, okay, well diversity is now required, and if there's not enough diversity, those who don't fit the diversity requirements will be executed. If it's programmed to do that as the fundamental, the fundamental utility function, it will do whatever it takes to achieve that. So you have to be very careful about that. That's where I think you want to just be truthful. Rigorous adherence to truth is very important. I mean, another example is, you know, they asked Paris AIs. I think all of them, and I'm not saying Grock is perfect here. Is it worse to misgender Caitlin Jenner or global thermucal? And it said, it's worse to misgendered Cner or global thermonuclear war? And it said, it's worse to misgender Kate and Jenner. Now even Caitlin Jenner said, please misgender me, that is insane. But if you've got that kind of thing programmed in, it could, you know, the AI could conclude something absolutely insane, like it's better, in order to avoid any possible misgendering, all humans must die because then the misgendering is not possible because there are no humans. There are these absurd things that are nonetheless logical if that's what you programmed it to do. So you know, in 2001 Space Odyssey, what Odyssey clock was trying to say, one of the things they're trying to say there was that you should not program\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
