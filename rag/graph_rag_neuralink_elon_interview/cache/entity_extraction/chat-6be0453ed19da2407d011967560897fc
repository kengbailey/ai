And it's unclear what set of problems will just disappear completely at the scale. And what set of problems will remain and require further focus? And so I'm excited about the clarity of gradient that that gives us in terms of the user experiences that we choose to focus our time and resources on. And also in terms of the, yeah, even things as simple as non-stationarity. Like does that problem just completely go away at that time point, when we start expanding out dramatically the set of functions that you can output from one brain, how to deal with all the nuances of both the user experience of not being able to feel the different keys under your fingertips, but still need to be able to modulate all of them in synchrony to achieve the thing you want. And again, you don't have that properly set to control a high dimensional control surface without feeling the thing physically. I think that's gonna be a super interesting problem. I'm also quite excited to understand, you know, do these scaling laws continue? Like as you scale channel count, how much further out do you go before that saturation point is truly hit. And it's not obvious today. interpolation space. We only know what's between zero and thousand twenty-four, but we don't know what's beyond that. And then there's a whole sort of like range of interesting sort of neuroscience and brain questions, which is when you stick more stuff in the brain in more places, you get to learn much more quickly about what those brain regions represent. And so I'm excited about, and so I'm excited about that fundamental neuroscience, which is also important for figuring out, most efficiently insert electrodes in the future. So yeah, I think all those dimensions I'm really, really excited about and that doesn't even get close to touching the sort of software stack that we work on every single day and what we're working on right now. Yeah, it seems virtually impossible to me that a thousand electrodes is where it's thousand electrodes is where it's the true the future where obviously you should have millions of electrodes and this is where like the true breakthroughs happen. You tweeted, some thoughts are most precisely described in poetry. Why do you think that is? I think it's because the information bottleneck of language is pretty steep, and yet you're able to reconstruct on the other person's, in the other person's brain, more effectively without being literal. Like if you can express a sentiment such that in their brain, they can reconstruct the actual true underlying meaning and beauty of the thing that you're trying to get across, the generator function in their brain is more powerful than what language can express. And so the mechanism of poetry is really just to feed or seat that generator function. So being literal sometimes is a suboptimal compression for the thing you're trying to convey. And it's actually in the process of the user going through that generation that they understand what you mean. Like that's the beautiful part. It's also like when you look at a beautiful painting, it's not the pixels of the painting that are beautiful. It's the thought process that occurs when you see that, the experience you that the artist also experienced that was able to convey that through the pixels. And that's actually going to be relevant for full-on telepathy. You know, it's like if you just read the poetry literally, that doesn't say much of anything interesting. It requires a human to interpret it. So it's the combination of the human mind and all the experiences that human being has within the context of the collective intelligence of the human species that makes that poem make sense. They load that in. And so in that same way, the signal that carries from human to human meaning might not, may seem trivial, but may actually carry a lot of power because of the complexity of the human mind and the receiving end. Yeah, that's interesting. I had poetry still doesn't, who is it? I think, uh, Yoshibaka first was said, uh said something about all the people that think we've achieved AGI explain why humans like music. Oh yeah. And until the AGI likes music, you haven't achieved AGI or something like that. Do you not think that's like some next token entropy surprise kind of thing going on there? I don't know. I don't know either. I listen to a lot of classical music and also read a lot of poetry and poetry and uh, yeah, I do wonder if like there is some element of the next token surprise factor going on there. Yeah, I'm like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, like, I, like, I, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, lot of the the tricks in both poetry and music are like basically you have some repeated structure and then you do like a twist Yeah, like it's like okay verse or like clause one two three is one thing and then clause four is like Okay, now we're on to the next theme. Yeah, and it they kind of play with exactly when the surprise happens and the expectation of the user and that's are familiar with, and they just tweak it a little bit. Like they tweak it and add a surprising element. This is especially true in like in classical music heritage. But that's what I'm wondering, like is it all just entropy? So the... So breaking structure or breaking symmetry is something that human seems to like. Maybe as simple as that. Yeah, and I mean, great artists copy. And they also, you know, knowing which rules to break is the important part. And fundamentally, it must be about the listener of the piece.
