I had, that's what everyone says. That's what everyone says, yeah, I had nothing. I had all positive. I just so full, I don't think so. I don't know. But I kept, I kept thinking about, it had like extremely high resolution, okay. It was just, and it's just, not from my relationship with that person, but just as the person themselves, I had just this deep gratitude of who they are. That's cool. I was just like this exploration. Like, you know, like Sims or whatever, you get to watch them. I got to watch people and just being how amazing they are. It sounds awesome. Yeah, it's great. I was waiting for- When's the demon coming? Exactly. Maybe I'll have some negative thoughts, nothing. Nothing. I had just extreme gratitude for them. And also a lot of space travel. When space travels where? So here's what it was. It was people, the human beings that I know, they had this kind of, the best way I could describe it is they had a glow to them. Okay. And then I kept flying out from them to see Earth, to see our solar system, to see our galaxy, and I saw that light, that glow all across the universe. Okay. Like that, whatever that form is, whatever that, like, did you go past the Milky Way? Yeah. Yeah, intergalactic. Yeah, intergalactic. Yeah, but always pointing in. Yeah. Past the Milky Way, past. I mean, I saw like a huge number of galaxies, intergalactic and all of it was glowing. So, but I couldn't control that trial because I would actually explore near distances to the soul system, see if there's aliens or any of that kind of stuff. I think it, I didn't know. They were aliens? Implication of aliens because they were glowing. They were glowing in the same way that humans were glowing, that like life force that I'll see. The thing that made humans amazing was there throughout the universe. Like there was these glowing dots. So I don't know. It made me feel like there is life, no life, not life, but something, whatever makes humans all throughout the universe. Sounds good. Yeah, it was amazing. No demons. I looked for the demons. There's no demons. There were dragons and they're pretty odd. So the thing about trees, is there anything scary at all? Uh, dragons? But they weren't scary? They were protected. So the thing is the plus a magic dragon. No, it was more like a game of thrown kind of trials. They weren't very friendly. They were very big. So the thing is that about giant trees at night, which is where I was. I mean the jungle is kind of scary. Yeah. The trees started to look like dragons and they were all like looking at me. Sure. Okay.the people didn't speak in English by the way, which made it even scary. Because we're not even like, you know, where worlds apart in many ways. It's just, uh, but yeah, there was not, they, they talk about the mother of the forest protecting you and that's what I felt like. And you're way out in the jungle. Way out. This is not like a tourist retreat. You know like like 10 miles outside of a free or something. No, we went. No, this is not a deep Amazon. So me and this guy, Paul Rosalie, who basically is Tarzan, he lives in the jungle. We went out deep and we just went crazy. Wow. Yeah. So anyway, can I get that same experience in a Neurlink? Probably, yeah. I guess that is the question for non-disabled people. Do you think that there's a lot in our perception, in our experience of the world that could be explored, they could be played with using Newlink? Yeah, I mean, Neuralink is, it's really a generalized input output device. You know, it's just, it's a reading electrical signals and generating electrical signals. And I mean everything that you've ever experienced in your whole life, smell, you know, emotions. All of those are electrical signals. So, it's kind of weird to think that this that your entire life experiences are still down to electrical signals for neurons but that is in fact the case. Or I mean if that's at least what all the evidence points to. So I mean you could you could if you turgulate the right neuron you could trigger a particular scent you, you could certainly make things glow. I mean, do pretty much anything. I mean, really you can think of the brain as a biological computer. So if there are certain, say, chips, elements of that biological computer that are broken, let's say your ability to, if you've got a stroke, that if you've had a stroke, that means you've got some part of your brain is damaged. If that, let's say it's a speech generation or the ability to move your left hand, that's the kind of thing that a neural link could solve. If you've got like a massive amount of memory loss that's just gone, well, we can't get the memories back. We could restore your ability to make memories, but we can't, you know, restore memories that are fully gone. Now, I should say, if maybe if part of the memory is there and the means of accessing the memory is the part that's broken, then we could re-enable the ability to access the memory. So, but you can think of it like RAM in your, you know, in a computer, if, you know, if the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAUL ROSALIE<|>PERSON<|>Paul Rosalie is a person who lives in the jungle and is described as basically being Tarzan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a company that develops implantable brain–machine interfaces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EARTH<|>GEO<|>Earth is the planet that the speaker observed from space)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILKY WAY<|>GEO<|>The Milky Way is the galaxy that the speaker observed and traveled past)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON<|>GEO<|>The Amazon is a jungle where the speaker and Paul Rosalie went deep into)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAME OF THRONES<|>EVENT<|>Game of Thrones is a reference used to describe the type of dragons seen by the speaker)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ROSALIE<|>AMAZON<|>Paul Rosalie and the speaker went deep into the Amazon jungle<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>PAUL ROSALIE<|>The speaker discusses the potential of Neuralink to replicate experiences like those with Paul Rosalie<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EARTH<|>MILKY WAY<|>The speaker observed Earth and traveled past the Milky Way<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
