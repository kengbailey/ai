And the experience they talk about is mostly just relief. Probably that they don't have to visualize it anymore. Yeah, the power of the mind to visualize and where, I mean, there's a whole field that studies where muscle memory lies in cerebellum. Yeah, it's incredible. I think it's a good place to actually ask sort of the big question that people might have is how do we know every aspect of this that you described is safe? At the end of the day the goal standard is to look at the tissue. You know what sort of trauma did you cause the tissue and does that correlate to whatever behavioral anomalies that you may have seen and that's the language to which we can communicate about the safety of inserting something into the brain and what type of trauma that you can cause. So we actually have an entire department, the department of pathology that looks at these tissue slices. There are many steps that are involved in doing this once you have, you know, studies that are launched to, with particular endpoints in mind, you know, at some point you have to euthanize the animal and then you go through necrops so you to kind of collect the brain tissue samples, you know, you fix them in formalin and you like gross them, you section them and you look at individual slices just to see what kind of reaction or lack thereof exists. So that's the kind of the language to which FDA speaks and you know as well for us to kind evaluate the safety of the insertion mechanism as well as the threats at various different time points, you know both acute so anywhere between you know zero to three months to beyond three months. So those are kind of the details of an extremely high standard of safety that has to be reached. Correct. FDA supervises this, but there's in general just a very high standard, and every aspect of this including the surgery. I think Matthew McDougal has mentioned that like the standard is, let's say how to put it politely, higher than maybe some other operations that we take for granted. So the standard for all the surgical stuff here is extremely high. Very high. I mean it's a highly, highly regulated environment with, you know, the governing agencies that scrutinize every medical device that gets marketed. And I think it's a good thing. You know, it's good to have those high standards. And we try to hold extremely high standards to kind of understand what sort of damage, if any, these innovative emerging technologies and new technologies that we're building are. And you know so far we have been extremely impressed by lack of immune response from these threads. Speaking of which you you talk to me with excitement about the histology and some of the images that you're able to share. Can you explain to me what we're looking at? Yeah, so what you're looking at is a stained tissue image. So this is a sectioned tissue slice from an animal that was implanted for seven months, so kind of a chronic time point. And you're seeing all these different colors. And each color indicates specific types of cell types. So purple and pink are astrocytes and microglia, respectively, they're type of glial cells. And the other thing that people may not be aware of is your brain is not just made up of soup of neurons and axons. There are other cells, like glial cells that actually kind of is the glue and also react if there are any trauma or damage to the tissue. With the brown or the neurons. The brown are the neurons. So what you're seeing is in this kind of macro image you're seeing these like circle highlighted in white the insertion sites and when you zoom into one of those you see the threads and then in this particular case I think we're seeing about the 16 you know wires that are going into the page and the incredible thing here is the fact that you have the neurons that are these brown structures or brown circular or elliptical thing that are actually touching and abutting the threads. So what this is saying is that there's basically zero trauma that's caused during this insert and with these neural interfaces, these microelectros that you insert that is one of the most common mode of failure. So when you insert these threads like the Utah array it causes neuronal death around the site because you're inserting a foreign object, right? And that kind of elicit these immune response through microglia and astrocytes. They form this protective layer around it. Not only are you killing the neuron cells, but you're also creating this protective layer, that then basically prevents you from recording neural signals because you're getting further and further away from the neurons that you're trying to record. And that that is the biggest mode of failure and in this particular example in that inset it's you know it's about 50 micron with that scale bar the neurons are just seemed to be no trauma. That's such a beautiful image by the way. It's just the, so the browner the neurons, and for some reason I can't look away. It's really cool. And the way that these things like, I mean, your tissues generally don't have these beautiful colors. This is multiplex stain that uses these different proteins that are staining these tainin the. You know, we use very standard set of, you know, staining techniques with HE, EBA1 and, you know, NU-N and G-FAP. So if you go to the next image, this is also kind of illustrates the second point because you can make an argument and initially when we saw the previous image, we said, oh, like, are the threats just floating? Like, what we actually looking at the right thing? So what we did is, we did another stain, and this is all done in-house, of this mason's trichrome stain, which\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MATTHEW MCDOUGAL<|>PERSON<|>Matthew McDougal is mentioned as someone who has commented on the high standards of surgical procedures in the context of the discussed technology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is a governing agency that supervises and scrutinizes medical devices and their safety standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Pathology is responsible for examining tissue slices to evaluate the safety and impact of medical procedures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UTAH ARRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Utah Array is a type of neural interface that can cause neuronal death and immune response when inserted into brain tissue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NECROPSY<|>EVENT<|>Necropsy is the process of examining animal tissue post-euthanasia to collect brain tissue samples for safety evaluation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTOLOGY<|>EVENT<|>Histology involves the study of stained tissue images to observe cellular reactions and trauma in brain tissue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEREBELLUM<|>GEO<|>The cerebellum is a part of the brain involved in muscle memory and coordination)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATTHEW MCDOUGAL<|>FDA<|>Matthew McDougal has commented on the high standards of surgical procedures that are regulated by the FDA<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FDA<|>DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY<|>The FDA supervises the Department of Pathology in evaluating the safety of medical procedures<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UTAH ARRAY<|>FDA<|>The FDA scrutinizes the safety of neural interfaces like the Utah Array<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NECROPSY<|>DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY<|>The Department of Pathology conducts necropsy to collect brain tissue samples for safety evaluation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTOLOGY<|>DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY<|>The Department of Pathology uses histology to study stained tissue images<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEREBELLUM<|>HISTOLOGY<|>Histology can be used to study the cerebellum and its cellular reactions<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
