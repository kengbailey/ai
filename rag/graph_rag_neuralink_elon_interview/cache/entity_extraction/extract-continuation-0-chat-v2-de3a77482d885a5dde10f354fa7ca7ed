Fortunately, everything went well, and that surgery is one of the smoothest outcomes we could have imagined. Were you nervous? I mean, you're a bit of a quarterback and like in the Super Bowl kind of situation. Extremely nervous. Extremely. I was very pleased when it went well and then and when it was over looking forward to number two. Yeah. Even with all that practice, all of that just you've never been in a situation that's so high stakes in terms of people watching. Yeah. And we should also probably mention, given how the media works, a lot of people, you know, maybe in a dark kind of way hoping it doesn't go well. Well, I think wealth is easy to hate or envy or whatever, and I think there's a whole industry around driving clicks and bad news is great for clicks. And so any way to take an event and turn it into bad news is going to be really good for clicks. It just sucks because I think it puts pressure on people, it discourages people from trying to solve really hard problems because to solve hard problems you have to go into the unknown. You have to do things that haven't been done before and you have to take risks. Yeah. Calculated risks, you have to do all kind of safety precautions, but risks never a lesson. I just wish there would be more celebration of that, of the risk-taking, versus like people just waiting on the sidelines, like waiting for failure. And then pointing out the failure, yeah, it sucks. But in this case, it's really great that everything went just flawlessly, but it's unnecessary pressure, I would say. Now that there's a human with literal skin in the game, you know, there's a participant who's well-being rides on this doing well, you have to be a pretty bad person to be rooting for that to go wrong. And so, you know, hopefully people look in the mirror and realize that at some point. So did you get to actually front row seat, like watch the robot work? Like what, you get to see the whole thing? Yeah, I mean, you know, because an MD needs to be in charge of all of the medical decision making throughout the process, I unscrubbed from the surgery after exposing the brain and presenting it to the robot and placed the targets on the robot interface that tells the robot where it's going to insert each thread that was done with my hand on the mouse for whatever that's worth. So you were the one placing the targets? Yeah. Oh, cool. So like it, you know, the robot with a computer vision provides a bunch of candidates and you kind of finalize the decision. Right. You know, the software engineers are amazing on this team. And so they actually provided an interface where you can essentially use a lasso tool and select a prime area of brain real estate and it will automatically avoid the blood vessels in that region and automatically place a bunch of targets. So, you know, that allows, you know, the human robot operator to select really good areas of brain and make dense applications of targets in that in those regions. The regions we think are going to have the most high fidelity representations of finger movements and arm movement intentions. I've seen like images of this and for me with OCDs for some reason are really pleasant. I think there's a subreddit called oddly satisfying. Yeah, I love that subreddit. It's oddly satisfying to see the different target sites avoiding the blood vessels and also maximizing like the usefulness of those locations for the signal. It just feels good. It's like ah. As a person who has a visceral reaction to the brain bleeding, I can tell you it's yes. It's extremely satisfying watching the electrodes themselves go into the brain and not cause bleeding. Yeah, so you said the feeling was of relief when everything went perfectly. How deep in the brain can you currently go and eventually go? Let's say on the neural link side, it seems the deeper you go in the brain, the more challenging it becomes. Yeah. So, talking broadly about neurosurgery, we can get anywhere. It's routine for me to put deep brain stimulating electrodes near the very bottom of the brain, entering from the top and passing about a 2mm wire all the way into the bottom of the brain. And that's not revolutionary. A lot of people do that. And we can do that with very high precision. I use a robot from Globus to do that surgery, you know, several times a month. It's pretty routine. What are your eyes in that situation? What are you seeing? What kind of technology can you use to visualize where you are to light your way? Yeah, so it's a cool process on the software side. You take a pre-operative MRI that's extremely high resolution data of the entire brain. You put the patient to sleep, put their head in a frame that holds the skull very rigidly, and then you take a CT scan of their head while they're asleep with that frame on, and then merge the MRI and the CT in software. You have a plan based on the MRI where you can see these nuclei deep in the brain. You can't see them on CT, but if you trust the merging of the two images, then you indirectly know on the CT where that is and therefore indirectly know where in reference to the titanium frame screwed to their head those targets are. And so this is 60s technology to manually compute trajectories given the entry point and target and dial in some goofy looking titanium actuators with manual actuators with little tick marks on them.
