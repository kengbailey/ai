The previous world record, in human was 4.6 said 8.5. Yeah, the previous world record in human was 4.6. Yeah. So it's almost double. And his goal is to try to get to 10, which is roughly around kind of the median neurolinker using a, you know, mouse with a hand. So it's getting there. So yes, so the performance was regained. Yeah, better than before. So that's, you know, a story on its own of what took the BCI team to recover that performance. It was actually mostly on kind of the signal processing in. So, you know, as I mentioned, we were kind of looking at these spike outputs from the, our electrodes. And what happened is that, kind of looking at these spike outputs from the our electrodes. And what happened is that kind of four weeks into the surgery, we noticed that the threats have slowly come out of the brain and the way in which we noticed this at first obviously is that, well I think Nolan was the first to notice that his performance was degrading. And I think at the time, we were also trying to do a bunch of different experimentation, you know, different algorithms, different sort of UI, UX. So it was expected that there will be variability in the performance, but we did see kind of a steady decline, and then also, the way in which we measure the health of the electrodes or whether they're in the brain or not is by measuring impedance of the electrode. So we look at kind of the interfacial, kind of the Randall circuit, let they say, the capacitance and the resistance between the electro surface and the medium. And if that changes in some dramatic ways, we have some indication, or if you're not seeing spikes on those channels, you have some indications that something's happening there. And what we noticed is that looking at those impedance plot and spike rate plots, and also because we have those electrodes recording along the death, you're seeing some sort of movement that the reservoir being pulled out. And that obviously will have an implication on the model side because if you're the number of inputs that are going into the model is changing because you have less of them, that model needs to get updated, right? And um, but there were still signals and as I mentioned similar to, even when you place the signals on the surface of the brain or further away, like outside the skull, you still see some useful signals, what we started looking at is not just the spike occurrence through this boss algorithm that I mentioned, but we started looking at just the power of the frequency band that is interesting for Nolan or Nolan to be able to modulate. So once we kind of changed the algorithm for the implant to not just give you the boss output but also these spike band power output, that helped us sort of we find the model with the new set of inputs and that that was the thing that helped us sort of be find the model with the new set of inputs and that that was the thing that really ultimately gave us the performance back. You know in terms of and obviously like the thing that we want ultimately and the thing that we are working towards is figuring out ways in which we can keep those threads intact for as long as possible so that we have many more channels going into the model. That's by far the number one priority that the team is currently embarking on to understand how to prevent that from happening. The thing that I will say also is that, you know, as I mentioned, this is the first time ever that we're putting these threats in the human brain. And human brain, just for a size reference, is 10 times that of the monkey brain or the sheep brain. And it's just a very, very different environment. It moves a lot more. It's like actually moved a lot more than we expected when we did Nolan surgery. And it's just a very, very different environment than what we're used to. And this is why we do clinical trial. We wanna uncover some of these issues and failure modes earlier than later. So in many ways, it's provided us with this enormous amount of data and information to be able to solve this. And this is something that NeurLink is extremely good at. Once we have set of clear objective and engineering problem, we have enormous amount of talents across many, many disciplines, to be able to come together and fix the problem very, very quickly. But it sounds like one of the fascinating challenges here is for the system and the decoding side to be adaptable across different time scales. So whether it's movement of threads or different aspects of signal drift, sort of on the software of the human brain, something changing. Like Nolan talks about cursor drift, they could be corrected, and there's a whole UX challenge to how to do that. So it sounds like adaptability is like a fundamental property that has to be engineered in. It is, and I mean, I think, I mean, as a company, we're extremely vertically integrated. You know, we make these thin film arrays in our own microfab. Yeah, there's like you said built in-house, this whole paragraph here from this blog post is pretty gangster. Building the technology is described above has been no small feet and there's a bunch of links here that I recommend people click on. We constructed in-house microfabrication capabilities to rapidly produce various iterations of thin film arrays that constitute our electrode threads. We created a custom femto second laser mill manufacture components with micro level precision. I think there's a tweet associated with this. That's a whole thing that we can get into. Yeah this this okay what are we looking at here?
