I was just trying to like get over like train my eyes to start looking ahead like okay this is the target I'm on but if I look over here to this target I know I can like maybe be a bit quicker getting there and I looked over and the cursor just shot over it's oh it was wild like I had to take a step day I was just smiling. I was so giddy. I was like, guys, do you know that this works? Like, I can just think it and it happens. Which, like, they'd all been saying this entire time, like, I can't believe like you're doing all this with your mind. I'm like, yeah, but is it really with my mind? Like, I'm attempting  the first time like that, it was, oh man, it like, it made me think that this technology, that what I'm doing is actually way, way more impressive than I ever thought. It was way cooler than I ever thought, and it just opened up a whole new world of possibilities of like what could possibly happen with this technology and what I might be able to be capable of with it. Because you had felt for the first time like this was digital telepathy. Like you're controlling a digital device with your mind. Yeah. I mean this is a real moment of discovery. That's really cool. Like you've discovered something. I've seen like scientists talk about like a big aha moment, you know, like Nobel Prize winning, they'll have this like holy crap. Yeah, like that's what it felt like. Like I didn't feel like like I had discovered something but for me, maybe not necessarily for like the world at large or like this field at large, it just felt like an aha moment for me. Like, oh, this works, like obviously it works. And so that's what I do like all the time now. I kind of intermix the attempted movement and imagined movement. I do it all like together because I've found that there is some interplay with it that maximizes efficiency with the cursor. So it's not all like one or the other, it's not all just I only use attempted or I only use like imagine movements. It's more I use them in parallel and I can do one of the other. I can just completely think about whatever I'm doing. But I don't know. I like to play around with it. I also like to just experiment with these things. Like every now and again I'll get this idea in my head like, hmm, I wonder if this works. And I'll justtell them, by the way, I wasn't doing that like you guys wanted me to. I was, I thought of something and I wanted to try it, and so I did. It seems like it works, so maybe we should like explore that a little bit. So I think that discovery is not just for you, at least from my perspective, that's the discovery for everyone else, who ever uses in your link that this is possible. Like I don't think that's an obvious thing that this is even possible. It's like I was saying to Bliss earlier, it's like the four-minute mile. People thought it was impossible to run a mile in four minutes and once the first person did it, then everyone just started doing it. So like just to show that it's possible that paves the way to like anyone can not do it. That's a thing that's actually possible. You don't need to do the attempt movement. You can just go direct. That's crazy. It is crazy. For people who don't know, can you explain how the Link app works? You have an amazing stream on the topic, your first stream, I think, on X, describing the app, can you just describe how it works? Yeah, so it's just an app that Neurlink created to help me interact with a computer. So on the Link App, there are a few different settings and different modes and things I can do on it. So there's like the body mapping, if we kind of touched on. There's a calibration. Calibration is how I actually get cursor control. So calibrating what's going on in my brain to translate that into cursor control. So it will pop out models. What they use, I think, is like time so it would be you know five minutes and calibration will give me so good of a model and then if I'm in it for 10 minutes and 15 minutes the models will progressively get better and so you know the longer I'm in it generally the better the models will get. That's really cool because you often refer to the models. The model is a thing that's constructed once you it generally, the better the models will get. That's really cool, because you often refer to the models. The model is the thing that's constructed once you go through the calibration step. And then you also talked about sometimes you'll play like a really difficult game, like Snake, just to see how good the model is. Yeah, yeah, so Snake is kind of my litmus test for models. If I can control Snake decently well, then I know I have a pretty good model. So yeah, the Linkap has all of those. It has web grid in it now. It's also how I connect to the computer just in general. So they've given me a lot of voice controls with it at this point. So I can, you know, say, connect or implant disconnect. And as long as I have that charger handy, then I can connect to it. So the charger is also how I connect to the link app to connect the computer. I have to have the implant charger over my head when I want to connect to have\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a neurotechnology company that developed the Link app to help users interact with computers using their minds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINK APP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Link app is a software created by Neuralink to facilitate brain-computer interaction, allowing users to control a cursor and other functions through mental commands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLISS<|>PERSON<|>Bliss is a person mentioned in the context of discussing the capabilities of the Link app and its potential)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>X<|>ORGANIZATION<|>X is a platform where the first stream describing the Link app was shared)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOUR-MINUTE MILE<|>EVENT<|>The four-minute mile is a historical athletic achievement that was once thought impossible until it was accomplished, serving as an analogy for the breakthroughs in brain-computer interface technology)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>LINK APP<|>Neuralink developed the Link app to enable brain-computer interaction<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINK APP<|>X<|>The Link app was described in a stream on the platform X<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLISS<|>FOUR-MINUTE MILE<|>Bliss was mentioned in a discussion comparing the breakthrough in brain-computer interface technology to the achievement of the four-minute mile<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
