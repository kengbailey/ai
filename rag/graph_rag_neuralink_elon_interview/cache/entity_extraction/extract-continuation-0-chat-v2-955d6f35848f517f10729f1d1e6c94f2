Then once they have a model, you could imagine them using that model and actually adapting to it and figuring out the right way to use it themselves, and then retraining in that data to give you sort of a boost in performance. There's a lot of challenges associated with both of these techniques, and we can sort of wrap it whole into both loop task is that the user themselves doesn't get pro-receptive feedback about what they're doing. They don't, you know, necessarily perceive themself or feel, you know, the mouse under their hand when they're using an open loop calibration. They're being asked to perform something. Like, imagine if you sort of had your whole right arm numbed and you stuck it in a box and you couldn't see it. So you had no visual. the had no appropriate set to feedback about what the position or activity of your arm was. And now you're asked, okay, given this thing on the screen that's moving from left to right, match that speed. And you basically can try your best to you know invoke whatever that imagined inconsistent in how you do that task. And so that's sort of the fundamental challenge of open loop. The challenge with closed loop is that once the user is given a model and they're able to start moving the mouse on their own, they're going to very naturally adapt to that model. And that co-adaptation between the model, the model, their th and the user learning how to use the model may not find you the best of global minima. Maybe that your first model was noisy in some ways or maybe just had some like quirk. Like if there's some like part of the data distribution it didn't cover super well and the user now, they're a brilliant user like Nolan, they figure out the right angle they have to hold their hand out to get it to work. And they'll get it to work great, but then the next day they come back to their device, and maybe they don't remember exactly all the tricks that they use the previous day. And so there's a complicated sort of feedback cycle here that can emerge and can make it a very difficult Yeah, actually just to stay on the closed loop. I've seen situations. This actually happened watching psychology grad students. They use piece of software when they don't know how to program themselves. They use piece of software that somebody else wrote. And it has a bunch of bugs. And they figure out, like, and they've been using it for years. They figure out ways to work around, oh, that just happens. Like, nobody has, nobody like considers maybe we should fix this. They just adapt. And that's a really interesting notion that we just said, we're really good at it adapting. But you need to still, that might not be the optimal. Okay, so how do you solve that problem? Do you have to restart from scratch every once in a while kind of thing? Yeah, it's a good question. First and foremost, I would say this is not a solve problem. And for anyone who's listening in academia who works on BCIs, I would also say this is not a problem that's solved by simply scaling channel count. So this is a good, thrown. So this is a good, you know, maybe that that that can maybe, to come up with good labeling strategies. But if you're interested in problems that aren't going to be solved inherently by scaling channel account, this is one of them. Yeah, so how do you solve it? It's not a solved problem. That's the first thing I want to make sure it gets across. The second thing is any solution that involves closed loop, to tackle is that you want to choose the one that's going to be the easiest to debug. Because if you can do that, even if the ceiling is lower, you're going to be able to move faster because you have a tighter iteration loop's worth understanding is that even in a closed loop setting, there's no special software magic of how to infer what the user is truly attempting to do. In the closed loop setting, although they're moving the cursor on the screen, they may be attempting something different than what your model is outputting. be able to improve the model further. You still have this very complicated guesstimation or unsupervised problem of figuring out what is the true user intention underlying that signal. And so the open loop problem has the nice property of being easy to debug, and the second nice property of it has all the same information content as the close-up scenario. Another thing I want to mention and call out is that this problem doesn't need to be solved in order to give useful control to people. Even today with the solutions we have now and that academia has built up over decades, the level of control that can be given to a user today is quite useful. It doesn't need to be solved to get to that level of control. But again, I want to build the world's best mouse, the superhuman version, you really need to nail that problem. And a couple maybe details of previous studies that we've done internally that I think are very interesting to understand when thinking about how to solve this problem, the first is that even when you have ground truth of what the user is trying to do. And you can get this with an able-bodied monkey, a monkey that has a neural device implanted and moving a mouse to control a computer. Even with that ground-truth data set, it turns out that the optimal thing to predict, to produce high-performance BCI, is not just the direct on in the brain and what is the mouse exactly doing on the table. And it turns out that if you build the mapping from neural spikes to predict exactly what the mouse is doing, that model will\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>Nolan is described as a brilliant user who figures out the right angle to hold their hand to get a model to work)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSYCHOLOGY GRAD STUDENTS<|>PERSON<|>Psychology grad students use a piece of software with bugs and adapt to it over years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BCI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BCI refers to Brain-Computer Interfaces, a field in academia working on neural devices and control systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Academia is involved in research and development of BCIs and other neural control systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABLE-BODIED MONKEY<|>PERSON<|>A monkey with a neural device implanted, used in studies to control a computer mouse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURAL DEVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A device implanted in the brain to control external devices like a computer mouse)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>BCI<|>Nolan is a user of BCI models and adapts to them<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PSYCHOLOGY GRAD STUDENTS<|>SOFTWARE<|>Psychology grad students use a piece of software with bugs and adapt to it<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BCI<|>ACADEMIA<|>BCI is a field within academia<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABLE-BODIED MONKEY<|>NEURAL DEVICE<|>An able-bodied monkey has a neural device implanted to control a computer mouse<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABLE-BODIED MONKEY<|>BCI<|>An able-bodied monkey is used in BCI studies to control a computer mouse<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
