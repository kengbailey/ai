Yeah, yep. This is going to be a fun one. Let's go. So, maybe before diving into what we do, it's worth understanding what we're trying to measure because that dictates a lot of the requirements for the system that we build. And what we're trying to measure is really individual neurons producing action potentials. An action potential is, you can think of it like a little electrical impulse that you can detect if you're close enough. And by being close enough, I mean like within, let's say a hundred microns of that cell and hundred microns is a very very tiny distance and so the number of neurons that you're going to pick up with any given electrode is it just a small radius around that electrode and the other thing worth of the understanding about the underlying biology here is  to the end of the spike, that whole width of that sort of characteristic feature of a neuron firing is one millisecond wide. And if you want to detect that an individual spike is occurring or not, you need to sample that a signal or sample the local field potential, the local field potential, much more frequently than once a millisecond. You need to sample many, many times per millisecond to be able to detect that this is actually the characteristic waveform of a neuron producing an action potential. And so we sample across all thousand twenty times a second. Twenty thousand times a second means for already given one millisecond window, we have about 20 samples that tell us what that exact shape of that action potential looks like. And once we've sort of sampled at super high rate the underlying electrical field nearby these cells, we can process that signal into just where do we detect a spike or where do we not? Sort of a binary signal one or zero, do we detect a spike in this one millisecond or not. And we do that because the actual information carrying sort of subspace of neural activity is just when our spikes occurring. Essentially everything that we care about for decoding can be capture represented in the frequency characteristics of spike trains, meaning how often are spikes firing in any given window of time. And so that allows us to do sort of a crazy amount of compression from this very rich, high-density, you know, signal to something that's much, much more sparse and compressible that can be sent out over a wireless radio, like a Bluetooth communication, for example. Quick tangents here. You mentioned electrode neuron. There's a local neighborhood of neurons nearby. How difficult does it to, like like isolate from where the spike came from? Yeah, so there's a whole field of sort of academic neuroscience work on exactly this problem of basically given a single electrode or given a set of electrodes measuring a set of neurons, how can you sort of sort, spike sort, which spikes are coming from what neuron? And this is a problem that's pursued in academic work because you care about it for understanding what's going on in the underlying sort of neuroscience of the brain. If you care about understanding how the brain's representing information, how that's evolving through time, then that's a very, very important question to understand. For sort of the engineering side of things, at least at the current scale, if the number of neurons per electrode is relatively small, you can get away with basically ignoring that problem completely. You can think of it like sort of a random projection of neurons two electrodes. And there may be in some cases, that's a totally reasonable trade-off to make and can simplify the problem a lot. And as you sort of scale out channel count, the relevance of distinguishing individual neurons becomes less important, because you have more overall signal and you can start to rely on sort of correlations or covariance in the data to help understand when that channel is firing, what does that actually represent? Because you know that when that channel is firing in concert with these other 50 channels, that means move left. But when that same channel is firing with concert with these other 10 channels, that means move right. Okay, so you have to do this kind of spike detection on board. And you have to do that super efficiently so fast and not use too much power because you don't want to be generating too much heat so that to be a super simple signal processing step. Is there some wisdom you can share about what it takes to overcome that challenge? Yeah, so we've tried many different versions of basically turning this raw signal into sort of a feature that you might want to send off the device. And I'll say that I don't think we're at the final step of this process. This is a long journey. We have something that works clearly today, but there can be many approaches that we find in the future that are much better than what we do right now. So some versions of what we do right now, and there's a lot of academic heritage here, to to to to to to to these ideas, so I don't want to claim that these are original NERLink ideas or anything like that. But one of these ideas is basically to build a sort of like a convolutional filter almost, if you will, that slides across the signal and looks for a certain template to be matched. And that template consists of sort of how deep the spike, the whole process takes. And if you can see in the signal that that template is matched within certain bounds, then you can say, okay, that's a spike. One reason that approach is super convenient is that you can actually implement that extremely efficiently in hardware, which means that you can run it in a low power across a thousand two-a. Another approach that we've recently started exploring, and this can be combined with the spike detection approach, something called spike bandpower. And the benefits of that approach are that you may be able to pick\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
