But of course, you know, maybe I'm okay paying that cost, but there's hundreds of millions of people paying that cost nonstop, but in this case, this is necessary because there's an extra cost paid by Nolan for the jitteriness. So you have to switch between the scrolling and the reading. There has to be a phase shift between the two. Like, when you're scrolling, you're scrolling. Right, right. So that is one drawback of the current approach. Maybe one other just sort of case study here. So again, UX is how it works and we think about that holistically from like the even the feature detection level of what we detect in the brain to how we design the decoder, to how we choose to decode to then how it works once it's being used by the user. So another good the decoder says. It's also a function of, you know, what's going on on the screen. So we can understand, for example, that, you know, when you're trying to close a tab, that very small, stupid little X, that's extremely tiny, which is hard to get precisely hit if you're dealing with sort of a to like the iOS keyboard for example, it actually adapts the target size of individual keys based on an underlying language model. So it'll actually understand if I'm typing, hey, I'm going to see L, it'll make the e-key bigger because it knows Lex is a person know, improvements to the underlying decoder or feature detection part of the stack. So we do that with a feature called magnetic targets. We actually index the screen and we understand, okay, these are the places that are, you know, very small targets that might be difficult to hit. Here's the kind of cursor dynamics around that location. That might be indicative of the size of it in a way that makes it easier for the user to sort of snap onto that target. So all these little details, they matter a lot in helping the user be independent in their day-to-day living. So how much of the work on the decoder is generalizable to P2, P2, P2, P1? How do you improve the decoder in a the way to decode is going to look very different in P2 than in P1. For example, channel number 345 is going to mean something different in user 1 than it will in user 2, just because that electrode that corresponds with channel 345 is going to be in next to a different neuron in user 1 person user. But the approach is the methods, the user experience of how do you get the right behavioral pattern from the user to associate with that neural signal, we hope that will translate over multiple generations of users. And beyond that, it's very, very possible, in fact, quite likely that we've overfit to sort of Nolan's user experience, desires and preferences. And so what I hope to see is that, you know, when we get a second what the right wide minimas are that cover all the cases that make it more intuitive for everyone. And hopefully there's a cross-pollination of things where, oh, we didn't think about that with this user because, you know, they can speak, but with this user who just can't, but with this user who just can't speak, but with this user who just can't, you're, the user experience of open, toee, their, the, the, their doctor's office. So the actual mechanism of open loop labeling and then closed loop labeling would be the same and hopefully can generalize across the different users as they're doing the calibration step. And the calibration step is pretty cool. I mean, that in itself, the interesting thing about a web grid, which is like closed loop, it's like fun. I love it when there's like, they used to be kind of an idea of human computation, which is using actions a human would want to do anyway to get a lot of signal from. Yeah. And like, web grid is that, like a nice video game that also serves as great calibration. It's so funny. This is, I've heard this reaction so many times before sort of the you know first user was implanted we had an internal perception that the first user would not find this fun. And so we thought really quite a bit actually about like should we build other games that like are you know more interesting for the user so we can get this kind of data and help facilitate research that's you know for long duration stuff?s out that like people love this game. I always loved it but I didn't know that that was a shared perception. Yeah and just in case it's not clear, web grid is there's a grid of let's say 35 by 35 cells and one of them lights up blue and you have to move your mouse over that and click on it and if you miss it and it's red and I put this game for so many hours. So many hours. And what's your record you said? My I think I have the highest at Neurlink right now my record 17 BPS 17 BPS. Which is about if you imagine that 35 by 35 grade you're hitting about a hundred trials per minute. So a hundred correct selections in that one minute window. So you're averaging about you know between 500 600 600 milliseconds per selection. So one of the reasons I think I struggle with that game is I'm such a keyboard person. So everything is done with your keyboard. If I can avoid touching the mouse, it's great. So how can you explain your high performance? I have like a whole ritual I go through. I play web grid. It's actually like a diet plan associated with this, like this whole thing. The first thing. So, the first thing is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
