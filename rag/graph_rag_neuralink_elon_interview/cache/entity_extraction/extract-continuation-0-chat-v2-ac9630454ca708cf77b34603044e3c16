I'll stop it. There was, tragically, an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. After this, you tweeted that you endorse him. What's your philosophy behind that endorsement? What do you hope Donald Trump does for the future of this country and for the future of humanity? Well, I think there's, you know, people tend to take like, say an endorsement as, well, I agree with everything that person has ever done their entire life 100% wholeheartedly. And that's not going to be true of anyone. But we have to pick, we've got two choices, really, for who's president. And it's not just who's president, but the entire administer structure changes over. And I thought Trump displayed courage under fire, objectively. You know, he's just got shot. It's good blood streaming down his face and he's like fist pumping saying fight you know like that's impressive. Like you can't feign bravery in a situation like that. Like most people would have been ducking there would not be because it could be a second shooter you don't know. The president of the United States has got to represent the country and they're representing you, they're representing everyone in America. Well, I think you want someone who is strong and courageous to represent the country. That's not to say that he is without flaws, we all have flaws. But on balance, and certainly at the time it was a choice of, you know, Biden, poor guy has trouble climbing a flight of stairs and the other one's first pumping after getting shot. No comparison. I mean, who do you want dealing with some of the toughest people and other world leaders who are pretty tough themselves. And I mean I'll tell you like what are the things that I think are important, you know I think we want a secure border, we don't have a secure border. We want safe and clean cities. I think we want to reduce the amount of spending that were at least slowed down the spending and because we're currently spending at a rate that is bankrupting the country. The interest payments on US debt this year exceeded the entire Defense Department spending. If this continues all of the federal government taxes will simply be paying the interest. And then, and you keep going down that road, you end up, you know, in the tragedic situation that Argentina had back in the day. Argentina used to be one of those prosperous places in the world. And hopefully with Malay taking over, he can restore that. It was an incredible fullful grace for Argentina to go from being one of the most prosperous places in the world to being very far from that. So I think we should not take American prosperity for granted. So we really want to, I think, we've got to reduce the size of government, we've got to reduce the spending and we've got to live within our means. Do you think politicians in general, politicians, governments, how much power do you think they have to steer humanity towards good? I mean, there's a sort of age-old debate in history, like, you know, is history determined by these fundamental tides or is it determined by the captain of the ship? This is both, really. I mean, there are tides, but it also matters who's captain of the ship. So, it's a false dichotomy, essentially. There's, you, you, I mean, there are certainly tide, the tides of history are, there are real tides of history. And these tides are often technologically driven, if you say like the Gutenberg press, you know, the widespread availability of books as a result of a printing press, that was a massive tide of history, and independent of any ruler. But you know, in stormy times you want the best possible captain of the ship. Well first of all, thank you for recommending Will and Ariel Durant's work, I've read the short one for now. The lessons of history. And so one of the, well, said one of the lessons, one of the things they highlight is the importance of technology, technological innovation, and they, which is funny, because they've written, they wrote so long ago, but they were noticing that the rate of technological innovation was speeding up. Yeah, I would love to see what they think about now. But yeah, so to me, the question is how much government, how much politicians get in the way of technological innovation and building versus like help it and which politicians, which kind of policies help technological innovation. Because that seems to be, if you look at human history, that's an important component of empires rising and succeeding. Yeah, well, I mean, in terms of dating civilization, the start of civilization, I think the start of writing, in my view, is the, that's my, what I think is probably the right starting point to date civilization. And from that standpoint, civilization has been around for about 5,500 years when writing was invented by the ancient Samarians who were gone now, but the ancient Samarians, in terms of getting a lot of firsts, those ancient Samarians really have a long list of firsts. It's pretty well. In fact, Durant goes through the list of like, you want to see first, we'll show you first. The Sumerians just ask, we're just ask-kickers. And then the Egyptians who were right next to all, relatively speaking, they're like weren't that far. Developed an entirely different, the hieroglyphics. The hieroglyphics. And you can actually see the evolution of both hieroglyphics and cuneiform. Like the cuneiform starts off being very simple and then it gets more complicated and then towards the end. It's like, wow, okay, they really\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States who survived an assassination attempt and is known for his strong and courageous demeanor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIDEN<|>PERSON<|>Joe Biden is the current President of the United States, mentioned in the context of having physical difficulties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The country where Donald Trump and Joe Biden are political figures and where the assassination attempt on Trump took place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARGENTINA<|>GEO<|>A country that experienced a significant economic decline but is hopeful for recovery under the leadership of Javier Milei)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAVIER MILEI<|>PERSON<|>Javier Milei is a political figure in Argentina who is expected to help restore the country's prosperity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILL DURANT<|>PERSON<|>Will Durant is an author known for his work on the lessons of history, particularly the importance of technological innovation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARIEL DURANT<|>PERSON<|>Ariel Durant is an author who co-wrote with Will Durant on the lessons of history, emphasizing technological innovation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMERIANS<|>GEO<|>An ancient civilization known for inventing writing and achieving many firsts in human history)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGYPTIANS<|>GEO<|>An ancient civilization known for developing hieroglyphics and contributing significantly to early human history)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>UNITED STATES<|>Donald Trump is a former President of the United States and survived an assassination attempt in the country<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIDEN<|>UNITED STATES<|>Joe Biden is the current President of the United States<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGENTINA<|>JAVIER MILEI<|>Javier Milei is expected to help restore Argentina's prosperity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILL DURANT<|>ARIEL DURANT<|>Will Durant and Ariel Durant co-wrote works on the lessons of history<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMERIANS<|>EGYPTIANS<|>The Sumerians and Egyptians were ancient civilizations that made significant contributions to early human history<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
