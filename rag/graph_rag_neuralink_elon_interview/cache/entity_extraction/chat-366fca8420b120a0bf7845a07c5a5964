But then you realize these large language models come along and they're really damn good at generating code. So it's overnight you could be surprised like wow what is the contribution of the human really. But then you start to think okay it does seem that humans have ability like you said to deal with novel situations and in the case of programming it's the ability to kind of come up with novel ideas to solve problems. It's it seems like machines aren't quite yet able to do that and when the stakes are very high when it's life critical as it is in surgery especially in your surgery then it starts the the stakes are very high for a robot to actually replace a human. But it's fascinating that in this case of Neurolink, there's a human robot collaboration. Yeah, yeah, it's I do the parts that can't do, and it does the parts I can't do. And we are friends. We are friends. I saw that there's a lot of practice going on. So, I mean, everything in Neuralik is tested extremely rigorously, but one of the things I saw that there's a proxy on which the surgeries are performed. So this is both for the robot and for the human, for everybody involved in the entire pipeline. What's that like practicing the surgery? for the human, for everybody involved in the entire pipeline. Yep. What's that like practicing the surgery? It's pretty intense. So there's no analog to this in human surgery. Human surgery is sort of this artisanal craft that's handed down directly from master to pupil over the generations. I mean, literally the way you learn to be a surgeon on humans is by doing surgery on humans. I mean, first you watch your professors do a bunch of surgery, and then finally they put, you know, the trivial parts of the surgery into your hands, and then the more complex parts, and as your understanding of the point and the purposes of the surgery into your hands and then the more complex parts and as your understanding of the point and the purposes of the surgery increases you get more responsibility in the perfect condition. It doesn't always go well. In Neurlink's case, the approach is a bit different. We of course practiced as far as we could on animals. We did hundreds of animal surgeries. And when it came time to do the first human, we had just a amazing team of engineers build incredibly lifelike models. One of the engineers, Fran Romano, in particular, built a pulsating brain in a custom 3D printed skull that matches exactly the patient's anatomy, including their face and scalp characteristics. And so when I was able to practice that, I mean, it's as close as it really reasonably should get to to being the real thing in all the details, including having a mannequin body attached to this custom head. And so when we were doing the practice surgeries, we'd wheel that body into the CT scanner and take a mock CT scan and wheel it back in and conduct all the normal safety checks, verbally, you know, stop this patient, we're confirming his identification is mannequin number, blah, blah, blah, and then opening the brain in exactly the right spot using standard operative neuronavigation equipment, standard surgical drills in it in the same OR that we do all of our practice surgeries in at Neurlink, and having the skull open and have the brain pulse, which adds a degree of difficulty for the robot, you know, perfectly precisely plan and insert those electrodes to the right depth and location. And so, yeah, we kind of broke new ground on how extensively we practiced for this surgery. So there was a historic moment, a big milestone for Neurolink, in part for humanity, with the first human getting a Neurlink implant in January of this year. Take me through the first human getting a Neurlink implant in January of this year. Take me through the surgery on Nolan. What did you feel like to be part of this? Yeah. Well, we were lucky to have just incredible partners at the Baro Neurologic Institute. They are, I think, the premier neurosurgical hospital in the world. They made everything as easy as possible for the trial to get going and helped us immensely with their expertise on how to arrange the details. It was a much more high-pressure surgery in some ways. I mean, even though the, you know, the outcome the details, it was a much more high pressure surgery in some ways. I mean, even though the, you know, the outcome wasn't particularly in question in terms of, or participant safety, the number of observers, you know, the number of people, there's conference rooms full of people watching live streams in the hospital, rooting for this to go perfectly and that just adds pressure that is not typical for even the most intense production neurosurgery, say removing a tumor or, you know, placing deep brain stimulation electrodes. And it had never been done on a human before. There were unknown unknowns. And so definitely a moderate pucker factor there for the whole team, not knowing if we were going to encounter, say, a degree of brain movement that was unanticipated, or a degree of brain sag that took the brain far away from the skull and made it difficult to insert, or some other unknown problem. Fortunately, everything went well, and that surgery is one of the smoothest outcomes we could have imagined. Were you nervous? I mean, you're a bit of a quarterback and like in the Super Bowl kind of situation. Extremely nervous. Extremely. I was very pleased when it went well\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
