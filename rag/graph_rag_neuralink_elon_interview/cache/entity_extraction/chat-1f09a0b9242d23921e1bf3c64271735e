So if you want to sort off by reducing the number of requirements, and no matter how smart the person is who gave you those requirements, they're still done to some degree. If you have to start there, because otherwise you could get the perfect answer to the wrong question. So, try to make the question the least wrong possible. That's what question the requirements means. And then the second thing is try to delete the, whatever the step is, the part or the process step. Sounds very obvious, but people often forget to try to deleting it entirely. And if you're not forced to put back at least 10% of what you delete, you're not deleting enough. And it's somewhat illogically, people often, most of the time feel as though they've succeeded if they've not been forced to put things back in. But actually they haven't because they've been overly conservative and have left things in there that shouldn't be. So and only the third thing is try to optimize it or simplify it. Again, the sounds, these all sound I think very, very obvious when I say them, but the number of times I've made these mistakes is more than I care to remember. That's why I have this mantra. So in fact, I'd say the most common mistake of smart engineers is to optimize the thing that should not exist. Right. So, so you, like you say, you run through the algorithm. Yeah. Basically, show up to a problem, show up to the supercomputer cluster and see the process and ask, can this be deleted? Yeah, first try to delete it. Yeah. Yeah. That's not easy to do. No, and actually, what generally makes people uneasy is that you've got to delete. No and actually this what what generally makes people uneasy is that you've got to delete at least some of the things that you delete you will put back in. Yeah. But going back to sort of where Olympic system can steer us wrong is that we tend to remember with sometimes a jarring level of pain where we deleted something that we subsequently needed. And so people will remember that one time they forgot to put in this thing three years ago and that caused them trouble. And so they're over-correct and then they put too much stuff in there and over-complicate things. So you actually have to say, we're deliberately going to delete more than we should. So that we're putting at least one in ten things we're going to add back in. And I've seen you suggest just that, that something should be deleted and you can kind of see the pain. Oh yeah, absolutely. Everybody feels a little bit of the pain. Absolutely. And I tell them in advance, like, yeah, there's some of the things that we delete we're gonna put back in and that people get a little shook by that but it makes sense because if you if you're so conservative as to never have to put anything back in you obviously have a lot of stuff that isn't needed. So you got to overcorrect. This is I would say like a cortical override to Olympic instinct. One or many that probably leads us astray. Yeah. There's like a step four as well which is any given thing can be sped up. How fast you think it can be done. Like whatever the speed is being done, it can be done faster. But you shouldn't speed things up until it's and until you've tried to delete it and optimize it, otherwise you're speeding up something that speeding up something that shouldn't exist as absurd. And then the fifth thing is to automate it. Yeah. And I've gonetired of doing that. So that's why I've got this mantra. That is a very effective five-step process. It works great. Well, when you've already automated deleting must be real painful. Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's like, wow, I really wasted a lot of effort there. I mean, what you've done with the with the cluster in Memphis is incredible just in a handful of weeks. Yeah, it's not working yet. So I want to pop the champagne corks. In fact, I have a call in a few hours with the Memphis team. Because we're having some power fluctuation issues. So, yeah, it's like kind of a, there's a, when you do synchronized training, when you, you've all these computers that are training, that where the training is synchronized to, you know, at the sort of millisecond level, you, it's like having an orchestra, and then thethe the orchestra can go loud to silent very quickly you know at sub second level and then the the electrical system kind of freaks out about that like if you suddenly see giant shifts 10 20 megawatts several times a second the this is not what electrical systems are expecting to see. So that's one of the main things you have to figure out the cooling, the power, the, and then on the software as you go up to stack, how to do the distributed computer, all that, all that, all that that's the problem is dealing with, with extreme power jitter. Power jitter. Yeah. It's a nice ring to that. So that's okay. And you stayed up late into the night as you often do there. Last week, yeah. Last week. Yeah. Yeah, we finally got a good training going at a roughly 420 a.m. Last Monday. Total coincidence. Yeah, I mean maybe it was 422 or something. Yeah. It's that universe again with the jokes. Exactly. It just loves it. I mean, I wonder if you could speak to the fact that you, one of the things that you did when I was there is you went through all the steps of what everybody's doing just\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
