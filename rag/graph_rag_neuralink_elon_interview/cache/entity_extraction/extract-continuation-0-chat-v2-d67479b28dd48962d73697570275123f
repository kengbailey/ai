And then you're grabbing it by the loop each individual thread and placing it in a particular location to avoid the blood vessels and also choosing the depth of placement all that right so controlling every like the 3D geometry of the placement correct so the the aspect of this robot that is unique is that it's not surgeon assisted or human assisted it's a semi-automatic or automatic robot once you know obviously there are human component to it when you're placing targets. You can always move it away from kind of major vessels that you see, but I mean we want to get to a point where one click and it just does the surgery within minutes. So the computer vision component finds great targets, candidates and the human kind of approves them and the robot does. Does it do like one thread at a time or does it do one thread at a time? It does one thread at a time? It does one threat at a time. And that's actually also one thing that we are looking at ways to do multiple threads at a time. There's nothing stopping from it. You can have multiple kind of mechanisms, but right now it's one by one and you know we also still do quite a bit of just kind of verification to make sure that it got inserted if so how deep you know did it actually match what was programmed in and you know so on and so forth. And the actual lecture is a place to vary at differing depths in the like I mean it's very small differences, but differences. Yeah, yeah. And so that there's some reasoning behind that, as you mentioned, like, it gets more varied signal. Yeah, we, I mean, we try to place them all around three or four millimeter from the surface, just because the span of the electrode, those 16 electrodes that we currently have in this version, spans you know roughly around three millimeters so we want to get all of those in the brain. This is fascinating. Okay so there's a million questions here. If we go zoom in specific on the electrodes, what is your sense? How many neurons is each individual electro listening to? Yeah, each electrode can record from anywhere between zero to 40, as I mentioned, right, earlier. But practically speaking, we only see about, at most, like, two to three. And you can actually distinguish which neuron it's coming from by the shape of the spikes. So I mentioned the spike detection algorithm that we have. It's called boss algorithm, buffer online spike sorter. Nice. It actually outputs at the end of the day six unique values which are, you know, kind of the amplitude of the day six unique values which are you know kind of the amplitude of these like negative going hump, middle hump, like positive going hump, and then also the time at which these happen and from that you can have a kind of a statistical probability estimation of is that a spike, is it not a spike and then based on that you could also determine, oh, that spike looks different than that spike must come from a different neuron. Okay, so that's a nice signal processing step from which you can then make much better predictions about if there's a spike, especially in this kind of context where there could be multiple neurons screaming. And that also results in you being able to compress the data better. Yeah. And just to be clear, I mean, the labs do this, what's called spike sorting. Usually, once you have these like broadband, you know, like the fully digitized signals and then you run a bunch of different set of algorithms to kind of tease apart. It's's just all of this for us is done on the device. On the device. In a very low-power, custom, you know, built, ASIC, digital processing unit. Highly heat constrained. And the processing time from signal going in and giving you the output is less than a microsecond, which is, you know, a very, very short amount of time. Oh, yeah, so the latency has to be super short. Correct. Oh, wow. Oh, that's a pain in the ass. Yeah, latency is this huge, huge thing that you have to deal with. Right now, the biggest source of latency comes from the Bluetooth. The way in which they're packetized, and, you know we've been them in 15 millisecond. Oh interesting, so it's communication constraint. Is there some potential innovation there on the protocol used? Absolutely. Okay. Yeah, Bluetooth is definitely not our final wireless communication protocol that we want to get to. It's a highly. Hence the N1 and the R1, I imagine that increases. And X, Rx. Yeah, that's, you know, the R1, I imagine that increases. And X, NX-RX. Yeah, that's, you know, the communication protocol because Bluetooth allows you to communicate against farther distances than you need to, so you can go much shorter. Yeah, the only, oh, the primary motivation for choosing Bluetooth is that, I mean, everything has Bluetooth. All right, so you can talk to interoperability is just absolutely essential, especially in this early phase. And in many ways, if you can access a phone or a computer, you can do anything. Well it'll be interesting to step back and actually look at, again, the same pipeline that you mentioned for Nolan. So, what does this whole process look like? From finding and selecting a human being to the surgery, to the first time he's able to use this thing? So we have what's called the patient registry, that people can sign up to hear more about the updates. And that was a route to which Nolan applied. And the process is that once the application comes in, you know, it contains some medical records. And we, you know, based on their\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROBOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A semi-automatic or automatic robot designed to perform surgeries with minimal human assistance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTER VISION COMPONENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A component of the robot that identifies great targets and candidates for surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSS ALGORITHM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Buffer Online Spike Sorter, an algorithm used for spike detection in neurons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, a custom-built digital processing unit used in the device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUETOOTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A wireless communication protocol used for data transmission in the device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A version of the device that uses Bluetooth for communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Another version of the device that uses Bluetooth for communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NX-RX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A communication protocol mentioned as a potential improvement over Bluetooth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>A patient who applied through the patient registry to use the device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATIENT REGISTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A system where people can sign up to hear more about updates and apply to use the device)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOT<|>COMPUTER VISION COMPONENT<|>The computer vision component identifies targets for the robot to perform surgeries<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOT<|>BOSS ALGORITHM<|>The robot uses the BOSS algorithm for spike detection in neurons<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOT<|>ASIC<|>The robot uses an ASIC for low-power, high-speed digital processing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOT<|>BLUETOOTH<|>The robot currently uses Bluetooth for wireless communication<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOT<|>N1<|>N1 is a version of the robot that uses Bluetooth<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOT<|>R1<|>R1 is another version of the robot that uses Bluetooth<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOT<|>NX-RX<|>NX-RX is mentioned as a potential communication protocol for the robot<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>PATIENT REGISTRY<|>Nolan applied through the patient registry to use the device<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
