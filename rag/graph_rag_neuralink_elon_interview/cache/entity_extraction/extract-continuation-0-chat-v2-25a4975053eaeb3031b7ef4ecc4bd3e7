If I do that with 0.3 versus 0.1, the models come out different. The way that they interact is just much, much different. So I have to be really careful. I found that doing it with 0.3 is actually better in some ways, unless I can do it with 0.1 and change all of the different parameters, then that's more ideal, because obviously 0.3 is faster than 0. So I could get there. I can get there. Can you click using your brain? For right now, it's the hover clicking with the dwell cursor. We, before all the thread retraction stuff happened, we were calibrating clicks, left-click, right-click. That was my previous ceiling, before I broke the record again with the dwell cursor, was, I think, on a 35-by- 35 grid with left and right click and you get more BPS more bits per second using multiple clicks because it's more difficult. Oh because what is it the book you get you're supposed to do either a left click or like right click yes a different colors yeah blue targets for right click is what they had done so my previous record of 7.5 was with with the blue and the orange targets for left click, orange targets for right click is what they had done. So my previous record of 7.5 was with the blue and the orange targets, yeah. Which I think if I went back to that now, doing the click calibration, I would be able to, and being able to like initiate clicks on my own, I think I would break that 10 ceiling, like in a couple days, Max. Yeah, you would start making bliss nervous about his 17 why do you think we haven't given him the yeah exactly exactly so what would it feel like with their attractions that there is some of the threads are attracted it sucked it was really really hard the day they told me was the day of my big neural link tour at their Fremont facility they told me was the day of my big Neurolink tour at their Fremont facility. They told me like right before we went over there, it was really hard to hear. My initial reaction was, all right, go in, fix it. Go and take it out and fix it. The first surgery was so easy. Like, I went to sleep a couple hours later, I woke up and here we are. I didn't feel any pain, didn't take like any pain pills or anything. So I just knew that if they wanted to, they could go in and put in a new one, like next day, if that's what it took. Because I just wanted it to be better and I wanted not to lose the capability. I had so much fun playing with it for a few weeks for a month. I had, like it had opened up so many doors for me and it opened up so many more possibilities that I didn't want to lose it after a month. I thought it would have been a cruel twist of fate if I had gotten to see the view from like the top of this mountain and then have it all come crashing down after a month. And I knew, like, say the top of the mountain, but like, how I saw it was I was just now starting to climb the mountain. And I was, like, there was so much more that I knew as possible. And so to have all of that be taken away was really, really hard. But then on the drive over to the facility, I don't know, like five-minute drive, whatever it is, I talked with my parents about it, I prayed about it, I was just like, you know, I'm not going to let this ruin my day. I'm not going to let this ruin this amazing tour that they have set up for me. I want to go show everyone how much I appreciate all the work they're doing. I want to go meet all of the people who have made this possible and I want to go have one of the best days of my life. And I did, and it was amazing, and it absolutely was one of the best days I've ever been privileged to experience. And then for a few days, I was pretty down in the dumps. But for like the first few days afterwards, I was just like I didn't know if it was ever going to work again. And then I just, I made the decision that it, even if I lost the ability to use the Neuralink, even if I lost out on everything to come, if I could keep giving them data in any way, then I would do that. If I needed to just do, like, some of the data collection every day or body mapping every day for a year, then I would do that. If I needed to just do like some of the data collection every day or body mapping every day for a year, then I would do it. Because I know that everything I'm doing helps everyone to come after me, and that's all I wanted. I guess the whole reason that I did this was to help people. And I knew that anything I could do to help, I would continue to do, even if I never got to use the cursor again, then, you know, I was just happy to be a part of it. And everything that I had done was just a perk. It was something that I got to experience. And I know how amazing it's going to be for everyone to come after me. So, might as well just keep trucking along, you know. That said, you were able to get to work your way up to get the performance back. So this is like going from Rocky 1 to Rocky 2.
