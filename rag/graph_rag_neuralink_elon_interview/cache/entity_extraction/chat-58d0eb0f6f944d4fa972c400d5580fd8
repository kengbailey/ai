I have to continuously keep it moving, basically. So like I said, there's a threshold where it will initiate a click. So if I ever drop below that, it'll start and I have 0.3 seconds to move it before it clicks anything. And if I don't want it to ever get there, I just keep it moving at a certain speed and like just constantly like doing circles on screen, moving it back and forth to keep it from clicking stuff. I actually noticed a couple weeks back, that I was not using the implant, I was just moving my hand back and forth or in circles, like I was trying to keep the cursor from clicking, and I was just doing it while I was trying to keep the cursor from clicking and I was just doing it Like while I was trying to go to sleep and I was like I was like okay, this is a problem I've lost I've lost a number of games because I'll accidentally click something like yeah, yeah, yeah, it happens in chess I've lost a number of games because I'll accidentally click something. I think the first time I ever beat you was because of an misclick. It's a nice excuse right? Yeah. It was always anytime you lose you could just say it was accidental. Yeah. You said the app improved a lot from version one when you first started using it. It was very different. So can you just talk about the trial and error that you went through with the team, like 200 plus pages of notes? Like what's that process like of going back and forth and working together to improve the thing? It's a lot of me just using it like day in and day out and saying like, hey, can you guys do this for me? Like give me this. I want to be able to do that. I need this. I think a lot of it just doesn't occur to them maybe until someone is actually using the app, using the implant. It's just something that they just never would have thought of. Or it's very specific to even like me, maybe what I want. It's something I'm a little worried about with the next people that come is, you know, maybe they will want things much different than how I set it up or what the advice I've given the team and they're going to look at some of the things they've added for me. I'm like that's a dumb idea, like why would he ask for that? And so I'm really looking forward to get the next people on because I guarantee that they're going to think of things that I've never thought of. They're going to think of improvements. I'm like, wow, that's a really good idea, like I wish I would have thought of that. And then they're also going to give me some pushback, but like, yeah, what you are asking them to do here, that's a bad idea. Let's do it this way. And I'm more than happy to have that happen. But it's just a lot of like, you know, different interactions with different games or applications, the internet just with the computer in general. There's tons of bugs that end up popping up left-right center. So it's just me trying to use it as much as possible and showing them what works and what doesn't work and what I would like to be better. And then they take that feedback and they usually create amazing things for me. They solve these problems in ways I would have never imagined. They're so good at everything they do. And so I'm just really thankful that I'm able to give them feedback and they can make something of it. Because a lot of my feedback is like really dumb. It's just like I want this, please do something about it. And we'll come back super well thought out and it's way better than anything I could have ever thought of or implemented myself. So they're just great. They're really, really cool. As the BCI community grows, would you like to hang out with the other folks with Neuralink? Like what relationship, if any, would you want to have with them? Because you said like they might have a different set of like ideas of how to use the thing. Yeah. Would you be intimidated by their web grid performance? No, no I hope compete. I hope day one they've like wiped the floor with me. I hope they beat it. And they crush it, you know, double it if they can. Just because on one hand, it's only going to push me to be better because I'm super competitive. I want other people to push me. I think that is important for anyone trying to achieve greatness is they need other people around them who are going to push them to be better. And I even made a joke about it on X once, like once the next people get chosen, like Q, Buddy Cop music, like I'm just excited to have other people to do this with and to like share experiences with, I'm more than happy to interact with them as much as they want, more than happy to give them advice. I don't know what kind of advice I could give them, but if they have questions, I'm more than happy. What advice would you have for the next participant in the clinical trial? That they should have fun with this, because it is a lot of fun. And that I hope they work really, really hard because it's not just for us. It's for everyone that comes after us. And, you know, come to me if they need anything, and to go to Neurlink if they need anything, man, Neurlink moves mountains. Like, they do absolutely anything for me that they can. And it's an amazing support system to have.
