All right, I'll sign up for that. Did you ever anthropomorphize the robot, R1? Like do you give it a name? Do you see it as like a friend that's like working together with you? I mean to a certain degree it's... Or anatomy who's going to take the job? To a certain degree it's... yeah, it's complex relationship. All the good relationships are. It's funny when in the middle of the surgery there's a part of it where I stand basically shoulder to shoulder with the robot. And so, you know, if you're in the room reading the body language, you know, it's my brother in arms there. We're working together on the same problem. Yeah, I'm not threatened by it. Keep telling yourself that. Yeah, it's, how have all the surgeries that you've done over the years, the people you've helped and the stakes, the high stakes that you've mentioned, how has it changed your understanding of life and death? Yeah. Um, you know, it gives you a very visceral sense that death is inevitable. You know, it gives you a very visceral sense, and this may sound trite, but it gives you a very visceral sense that death is inevitable. You know, on one hand, you know, you are, as a neurosurgeon, you're deeply involved in these, like, just hard to fathom tragedies, you know, young parents dying, leaving, you know, a four-year-old behind, say. And, and on the other hand, you know, it takes the sting out of it a bit because you see how just mind-numbingly universal death is. There's zero chance that I'm going to avoid it. I know, you know, techno-optimists right now and longevity buffs right now would disagree on that 0.000% estimate, but I don't see any chance that our generation is going to avoid it. Entropy is a powerful force and we are very ornate, delicate, brittle DNA machines that aren't up to the cosmic ray bombardment that we're subjected to. So on the one hand, every human that has ever lived died or will die. On the other hand, it's just one of the hardest things to imagine inflicting on anyone that you love is having them gone. I mean, I'm sure you've had friends that aren't living anymore and it's hard to even think about them. And so, I wish I had, you know, arrived at the point of nirvana where, you know, death doesn't have a sting. I'm not worried about it. But I can at least say that I'm comfortable with the certainty of it, if not having found out how to to take the tragedy out of it when I think about you know my kids either not having me or me not having them or my wife. Maybe I've come to accept the intellectual certainty of it but it may be the pain that comes to losing the people you love. I don't think I've come to understand the existential aspect of it, like, that this is going to end. And I don't mean like, in some trite way, I mean like, it certainly feels like it's not going to end. Like you live life like it's not going to end. Like you live life like it's not going to end. Right. And the fact that this light that's shining, this consciousness is going to no longer be at one moment, maybe today. It's like, it feels me when I really am able to load all that in with Ernest Becker's terror. Like it's a real fear. I think people aren't always honest with how terrifying it is. Yeah. I think the more you are able to really think through it, the more terrifying it is. It's not such a simple thing. Oh, well, this is the way life is. if you really can load that in, it's hard. But I think that's why the Stoics did it because it like helps you get your shit together and be like the well they were like the moment every single moment you're alive is just beautiful. Yeah. And it's terrifying that it's going to end is and it's like, like, you're like, almost like you're shivering in the cold, a child helpless, this kind of feeling. And then it makes you, when you have warmth, when you have the safety, when you have the love to really appreciate it. I feel like sometimes in your position, when you mention armor, just to see death, it might make you not be able to see that, the finiteness of life, because if you kept looking at that, it might break you. So it's good to know that you're kind of still struggling with that. There's the neurosurgeon and then there's a human. Yeah, and the human is still able to Struggle then feel the the fear of that and the pain of that. Yeah, you know It definitely makes you ask the question of how long how many time how many of these can you see and and not say I can't do this anymore. But, I mean, you said it well. I think it gives you an opportunity to just appreciate that you're alive today. And, you know, I've got, I've got three kids and an amazing wife and I'm really happy. Things are good. I get to help on a project that I think matters. I think it moves us forward. I'm a very lucky person. It's the early steps of a potentially gigantic leap for humanity. It's a really interesting one. And it's cool because like you read about\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
