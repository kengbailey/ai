Yeah, it would be, we would be something different. I mean some sort of futuristic side, well, I mean we're obviously talking about it by the way, like it's not like around the corner. It's you ask me what the distant future is like maybe this is like it's not super far away but 10, 15 years, that kind of thing. When can I get one? 10 years? Probably less than 10 years. Depends what you want to want to do, you know. Hey, if I can get like a thousand BPS. A thousand BPS and it's safe and I can just interact with a computer while laying back and eating Cheetos, I don't eat Cheetos. There's certain aspects of human computer interaction when done more efficiently and more enjoyably, I don't like worth it. Well, we feel pretty confident that I think maybe within the next year or two that someone with a neural link implant will be able to outperform a pro gamer. Nice. Because the reaction time would be faster. I got to visit time would be faster. I got to visit Memphis. Yeah, yeah. You're going big on compute. Yeah. You've also said play to win or don't play at all. So yeah. What does it take to win? For AI, that means you've got to have the most powerful training compute. And you're the rate of improvement of training compute has to be faster than everyone else or you will not win your AI will be worse So how can GROC let's say three that might be available like next year? Well, hopefully end of this year. Groc three for lucky. Yeah How can that be the best LLM, the best AI system available in the world? How much of it is compute? How much of it is data? How much of it is post-training? How much of it is the product that you package it up in? All that kind of stuff. I mean, they will matter. It's sort of like saying what, you know, let's say it's a Formula One race, like what matters more the car or the driver. I mean, they both matter. If a car is not fast, then, you know, if it's like, let's say it's half the horsepower of a competitor is, the best driver will still lose. If it's twice the horsepower, then probably even a mediocre driver will still win. So the training computer is kind of like the engine, the horsepower of the engine. So you really, you want to try to do the best on that and then, then how efficiently do you use that training compute and how efficiently do you do the inference, the use of the AI. So obviously that comes down to human talent. And then what unique access to data do you have? That also plays a role. Do you think Twitter data will be useful? Yeah, I mean, I think most of the leading AI companies have already scraped all the Twitter data. Not I think they have. So, on a go-forward basis, what's useful is the fact that it's up to the second. You know, that's because it's hard for them to scrape in real time. So there's an immediacy advantage that Grock has already. I think with Tesla and the real-time video coming from several million cars, ultimately tens of millions of cars. Withus. There might be hundreds of millions of Optimus robots, maybe billions, learning a train us not from the real world. That's the biggest source of data, I think ultimately is sort of Optimus probably. Optimus is gonna be the biggest source of data. Because it's- Because reality scales. Reality scales to the scale of reality. It's actually humbling to see how little data humans have actually been able to accumulate. Really, say how many trillions of usable tokens have humans generated where on a non-duplicative, like discounting spam and repetitive stuff, it's not a huge number. You run out pretty quickly. And optimist can go, so Tesla cars can unfortunately have to stay on the road. Optimus robot can go anywhere. There's more reality off the road and go off road. I mean, like the of the stroller can like pick up the cup and see, did it pick up the cup in the right way? Did it, you know, say you go, pour water in the cup? You know, did the water go in the cup or not go in the cup? Did it spill water or not? Simple stuff like that. But it can do, at that at scale, times a billion. You know, so generate useful data from reality. So it calls and effects stuff. What do you think it takes to get to mass production of humanoid robots like that? It's the same as cars, really. I mean, global capacity for vehicles is about 100 million a year. And it could be higher, it's just that the demand is on the order of 100 million year. And then there's roughly 2 billion vehicles that are in use in some way. So, which makes sense, like, the life of a vehicle is about 20 years. So at steady state, you can have 100 million vehicles produced a of a vehicle is about 20 years, so at steady state you can have 100 million vehicles produced a year with a 2 billion vehicle fleet, roughly. Now for humanoid robots, the utility is much greater. So my guess is humanoid robots are more like at a billion plus per year. But you know, until you came along and started building Optimus, it was thought to be an extremely difficult problem. I mean, still it\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a company developing implantable brain–machine interfaces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEMPHIS<|>GEO<|>Memphis is a city that was visited by the speaker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Groc is a company developing advanced AI systems and large language models (LLMs))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a company that produces electric vehicles and collects real-time video data from its cars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPTIMUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Optimus is a humanoid robot developed by Tesla, designed to perform various tasks and collect data from the real world)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Twitter is a social media platform whose data is being used by AI companies for training models)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>PRO GAMER<|>Neuralink's implant technology is expected to enable users to outperform professional gamers due to faster reaction times<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROC<|>TWITTER<|>Groc uses Twitter data for training its AI models, leveraging the immediacy of real-time data<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>OPTIMUS<|>Tesla is developing the Optimus humanoid robot to collect data and perform tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>GROC<|>Tesla's real-time video data from its cars is a valuable data source for Groc's AI training<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OPTIMUS<|>GROC<|>Optimus robots are expected to be a significant source of real-world data for Groc's AI systems<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
