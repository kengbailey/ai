At the end of they were doing electrical recording that's mediated by ionic currents, you know, movements of these charged particles, which is really, really hard for most people to think about. But turns out a lot of the activities that are happening in the brain, and the frequency band with which that's happening is actually very, very similar to sound waves and our normal conversation, audible range, range. So the analogy that typically is used in the field is in a few, if you have a football stadium, there's a game going on, if you stand outside the stadium, you maybe get a sense of how the game is going based on the cheers and the booze of the home crowd, whether the team is winning or not, but you have absolutely no idea what the score is, you have absolutely no idea what individual audience or is, you have absolutely no idea what individual audience or the players are talking or saying to each other what the next play is, what the next goal is. So what you have to do is you have to drop the microphone near into the stadium and then get near the source, like into the individual chatter. In this specific example, you would want to have it, you know, right next to where the huddle is happening. So I think that's kind of a good illustration of what we're trying to do when we say invasive or minimally invasive or implanted brain computer interfaces versus non-invasive or non-implanted brain interfaces. It's basically talking about where do you that microphone and what can you do with that information. So what is the biophysics of the read and write communication that we're talking about here as we now step into the efforts at NeuralLink? Yeah, so brain is made up of these specialized cells called neurons. There's billions of them, you know, tens of billions. You know, sometimes people grow in a hundred billion that are connected in this complex yet dynamic network that are constantly remodeling. They're changing their synaptic weights. And that's, you know, what we typically call neuroplasticity. And the neurons are also bathed in this, you know, their synaptic weights and that's, you know, what we typically call neuroplasticity. And the neurons are also bathed in this charged environment that is latent with many charge molecules, like potassium ions, sodium ions, chlorine ions, and those actually facilitate these, you know, through ionic current communication between these different networks. And when you look at the, look at a neuron as well, they have these membrane with a beautiful, beautiful protein structure called the voltage selective ion channels, which in my opinion is one of nature's best inventions. In many ways, if you think about what they are, they're doing the job of a modern day transistors. Transistors are nothing more at the end of the day than a voltage gated conduction channel. And nature found a way to have that very, very early on in its evolution. And as we all know, with the transistor, you can have many, many computation and a lot of amazing things that we have access to today. So I think it's one of those, just as a tangent, just a beautiful, beautiful invention that the nature came up with, these voltage-gated ion channels. I mean I suppose there is on the biological of every level of the complexity of the hierarchy of the organism there's going to be some mechanisms for storing information and for doing computation and this is just one such way but to do that with biological and chemical components is interesting. Plus like when neurons, I mean it's not just electricity, it's chemical communication, it neurons, I mean it's not just electricity, it's chemical communication, it's also mechanical. I mean these are like actual objects that have like, that vibrate. I mean they move. Yeah, they're actually, I mean, there's a lot of really, really interesting physics that are involved. And, you know, kind of going back to my work on ultrasound during grass school, there are groups and there are still groups looking at ways to cause neurons to actually fire an action potential using ultrasound wave. And the mechanism to which that's happening is still unclear, as I understand. It may just be that you're imparting some sort of thermal energy and that causes cells to depolarize in some interesting ways, but there are also these ion channels or even membranes that actually just open up its poor as they're being mechanically shook, right, vibrated. So there's just a lot of, you know, elements of these like move particles, which again, like that's governed by diffusion physics, right, movements of particles. And there's also a lot of kind of interesting physics there. Also not to mention, as Roger Penrose talks about the, there might be some beautiful weirdness in the quantum mechanical effects of all of this. And he actually believes that consciousness might emerge from the quantum mechanical effects there. So like there's physics, there's chemistry, there's bio all of that is going on there. Oh yeah yeah I mean you can yes there's a lot of levels of physics that you can dive into. But yeah in the end you have these membranes with these voltage-gated ion channels that selectively let these charged molecules that are in the extracellular matrix, like in and out. And these neurons generally have these like resting potential where there's a voltage difference between inside the cell and outside the cell. And when there's some sort of stimuli that changes the state such that they need to send information to the downstream network, you know, you start to kind of see these sort of orchestration of these different molecules going in and out of these channels, they also open up, like more of them open up once it reaches some threshold to a point where you have a depolarizing cell that\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
