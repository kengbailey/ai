And when there's some sort of stimuli that changes the state such that they need to send information to the downstream network, you know, you start to kind of see these sort of orchestration of these different molecules going in and out of these channels, they also open up, like more of them open up once it reaches some threshold to a point where you have a depolarizing cell that sends an action potential. So it's just a very beautiful kind of orchestration of these these molecules. And what we're trying to do when we place an electrode or parking it next to a neuron is that you're trying to measure these local changes in the potential, again, mediated by the movements of the ions. And what's interesting, as I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of physics involved. And the two dominant physics for this electrical recording domain is diffusion physics and electromagnetism. And where one dominates, where Maxwell's equation dominates versus fixed law dominates, depends on where your electrode is. If it's close to the source, mostly electromagnetic based, when you're farther away from it, it's more diffusion-based. So essentially when you're able to park it next to it, you can listen in on those individual chatter and those local changes in the potential, and the type of signal that you get are these canonical textbook neural spiking waveform. When you're, the moment and the type of signal that you get are these canonical textbook neural spiking waveform. When you're the moment you're further away and based on some of the studies that people have done you know Christoph Coke lab and and others once you're away from that source by roughly around a hundred micron which is about a width of a human hair you no longer here you no longer here from that neuron you're no longer able to kind of have the system sensitive enough to be able to record that particular local membrane potential change in that neuron. And just to kind of give you a sense of scale also, when you look at 100 micron voxel, so 100 micron by 100 micron box in a brain tissue, there's roughly around 40 neurons and whatever number of connections that they have. So there's a lot in that volume of tissue, so the moment you're outside of that, there's just no hope that you'll be able to detect that change from that one specific neuron that you may care about. Yeah, but as you're moving about this space, you'll be hearing other ones. So if you move another hundred micron, you'll be hearing chatter from another community. Correct. And so the whole sense is you want to place as many as possible electrodes and then you're listening to the chatter. Yeah, you want to listen to the chatter and at the end of the day you also want to basically let the software do the job of decoding. And just to kind of go to, you know, why ECOG and EG work at all, right? When you have these local changes, you know, obviously it's not just this one neuron that's activating, there's many, many other networks that are activating all the time. And you do see sort of a general change in the potential of this electro, like to just charge medium. And that's what you're recording when you're farther away. I mean, you still have some reference electrode that's stable in the brain that's just electroactive organ. And you're seeing some combination aggregate action potential changes and then you can pick it up right it's a much slower changing signals but you know there are these like canonical kind of oscillations and waves like gamma-ways beta ways like when you sleep that that can be detected because there's sort of a synchronized kind of global effect of the brain that you can detect. And I mean the physics of this go, like, I mean, if we really want to go down that rabbit hole, like there's a lot that goes on in terms of like why diffusion physics at some point dominates when you're further away from the source, you know, it is just a charge medium. So similar to how when you have electromagnetic ways propagating in atmosphere or in a charge medium like a plasma, there's this weird shielding that happens that actually further attenuates the signal signal as you move away from it. So, yeah, you see, like you do a really really deep dive on kind of the signal attenuation over distance, you start to see kind of one over our square in the beginning and then exponential drop-off. And that's the knee at whichthe biophysics that you need to understand is not as deep, because no matter where you're placing that you're listening to a small crowd of local neurons. Correct. Yeah, so once you penetrate the brain, you know, you're in the arena, so to speak. And there's a lot of neurons. that's studying like how the different groupings, the different sections of the seating in the arena, what they usually are responsible for, which is where the metaphor probably falls apart because the seating is not that organized in an arena. Also, most of them are silent. They don't really do much, you know, or they, their activities are, you know, you have to hit it with just the right set of stimulus. So they're usually quiet. They're usually very quiet. There's, I mean, similar to dark energy and dark matter, there's dark neurons. What are they all doing? When you place these electrode, again, like, within this hundred micron volume, you have 40 neurons, why do you not see only a handful? What's happening there? Well, they're mostly quiet, but like when they speak, they say profound shit, I think. That's the way I'd like to think about it.
