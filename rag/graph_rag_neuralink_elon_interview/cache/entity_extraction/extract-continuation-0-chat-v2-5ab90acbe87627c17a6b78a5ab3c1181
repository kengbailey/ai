What was the experience like of you being selected to be the first human being to have a neural device implant in your brain? Are you scared? Excited? No, it was cool. Like, I was never afraid of it. I had to think through a lot. Should I, should I do this, like be the first person? I could wait until number two or three and get a better version of the Neurlink. Like the first one might not work. Maybe it's actually gonna kind of suck. It's gonna be the worst version ever in a person. So why would I do the first one? I've already kind of been selected. I could just tell them, you know, like, okay, find someone else and then I'll do number two or three. I'm sure they would let me, they're looking for a few people anyways. But ultimately I was like, I don't know, there's something about had the chance that I would like to do something for the first time, this seemed like a pretty good opportunity. And I was never scared. I think my like faith had a huge part in that. I always felt like God was preparing me for something. I almost wish it wasn't this, because I had many conversations with God about not wanting to do any of this as a quadriplegic. I told him, you know, I'll go out and travel the world and talk to stadiums, thousands of people, give my testimony, I'll do all of it, but, like, heal me first. Don't make me do all of this in a chair. That sucks, that sucks, that sucks, that sucks, that sucks, that sucks, th, th, th, th, th, th, thousands of people give my testimony, I'll do all of it, but like heal me first. Don't make me do all of this in a chair. That sucks. And I guess he won that argument. I didn't really have much of a choice. I always felt like there was something going on. And to see how, I guess, easily I made it through the interview process and how quickly everything happened, how the star sort of aligned with all of this. It just told me, like as the surgery was getting closer, it just told me that it was all meant to be, and so I shouldn't be afraid of anything that's to come And so I wasn't I kept telling myself like you know You say that now, but as soon as the surgery comes you, thank you God that you didn't take my brain and my personality and my ability to think, my love of learning, like my character, everything, like thank you so much. As long as you left me that, then I think I can get by. And I was about to let people go, like, they're like, hey, we're gonna go put some stuff in your brain, like hopefully it works out. And so it was something that gave me pause. But like I said, how smoothly everything went. I never expected for a second that anything would go wrong. Plus, the more people I met on the borough side and on the nerling side. They're just the most impressive people in the world. Like I can't speak enough to how much I trust these people with my life and how impressed I am with all of them. And to see the excitement on their faces, to like walk into a room and roll into a room and see all of these people looking at me like we're just we're so excited Like we've been working so hard on this and it's finally happening It's super infectious and it just makes me want to do it even more and to help them achieve their dreams like. I don't know. It's so it's so rewarding and I'm so happy for all of them, honestly. What was the day of surgery like? What's, when'd you wake up? What did you feel? Yeah. Minute by minute. Yeah. Were you freaking out? No. I thought I was going to, but a surgery approach, the night before. I was just excited. I was like, let's make this happen. I think I said that, something like that to Elon on the phone beforehand. We were like, face timing, and I was like, let's rock and roll. And he's like, let's do it. I don't know. I just, I wasn't scared. So we woke up, I think we had to be at the hospital at like 5.30 a. I think surgery was at like th, like th, like th, like th, like th, like th, like th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th. th. thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like.m. So we woke up pretty early. I'm not sure much of us slept that night. Um, got to the hospital 5.30, went through like all the pre-op stuff. Everyone was super nice.
