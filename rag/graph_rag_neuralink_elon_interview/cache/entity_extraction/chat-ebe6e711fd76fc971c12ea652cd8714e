And then the Egyptians who were right next to all, relatively speaking, they're like weren't that far. Developed an entirely different, the hieroglyphics. The hieroglyphics. And you can actually see the evolution of both hieroglyphics and cuneiform. Like the cuneiform starts off being very simple and then it gets more complicated and then towards the end. It's like, wow, okay, they really get very sophisticated with the cuine form. So I think civilization is being about 5,and years old. And Earth is, if physics is correct, four and a half billion years old. So civilization has been around for one millionth of Earth's existence. Flash in the pan. Yeah, these are the early, early days. And so we we draw very dramatic because there's been rises and falls of empires and many. So many, so many so many rises and falls of empires. So many. so many rises and fools of vampires. So many. And there'll be many more. Yeah, exactly. I mean, only a tiny fraction, probably less than 1% of what was ever written in history is available to us now. I mean, if they didn't put it, literally chisel it in stone or put it in a clay tablet. We don't have it. I mean there's some small amount of like papyrus scrolls that were recovered that are thousands of years old because they were deep inside a pyramid and were affected by moisture. But other than that, it's really got to be in a clay tablet or chiseled. So the vast majority of stuff was not chiseled because it takes a while to chisel things. So that's why we've got tiny, tiny fraction of the information from history. But even that little information that we do have and the archaeological record shows so many civilizations rising and falling. It's for it's wild. We tend to think that we're somehow different from those people. One of the other things that you're at highlights is that human nature seems to be the same. It just persists. Yeah, I mean the basics of human nature are more or less the same. So we get ourselves in trouble in the same kinds of ways, I think, even with tend to see the same patterns, similar patterns, you know, for civilizations where they go through a life cycle like an organism. You know, sort of just like a human, it's sort of a zygo, fetus, baby, you know, toddler, teenager, you know, eventually gets hold and dies. The civilizations go through a life cycle. No civilization will last forever. What do you think it takes for the American Empire to not collapse in the year-term future in the next hundred years to continue flourishing. Well, the single biggest thing that is often actually not mentioned in history books, but Durant does mention it is the birthright. So, like a, perhaps, to some, a counterintuitive thing happens when civilizations become, are winning for too long. They've been, they, the birth rate declined. It can often decline quite rapidly. We're seeing that throughout the world today. You're currently, South Korea's like, I think maybe the lowest fertility rate. But there are many others that are close to it. It's like 0.8, I think. If the birth rate doesn't decline further, a South Korea will lose roughly 60% of its population. And, but every year that birth rate is dropping, and this is true through most of the world. I don't mean single out South Korea. It's been happening throughout the world. So as soon as any given civilization reaches a level of prosperity, the birth rate drops. And now you can go and look at the same thing happening in ancient Rome. So Julius Caesar took note of this, I think, around 50-ish BC, and tried to pass, I don't don't know if you're successful, try to pass a law to give an incentive for any Roman citizen that would have a third child. And I think Augustus was able to, well, he, you know, the dictator, so this Senate was just for show. I think he did pass a tax incentive for Roman citizens to have a third child. But it, those efforts were unsuccessful. Rome fell because the Romans stopped making Romans. That's actually the fundamental issue. And there were other things. So they were like, they had quite a serious malaria, serious malaria epidemics and plagues and whatnot. But they had those before. The, it's just that the birth rate was far within the death rate. It really is that simple. Well, I'm saying that's more people is acquired. At a fundamental level, if a civilization does not at least maintain its numbers, it will despair. So perhaps the amount of compute that the biological computer allocates to sex is justified. In fact, we should probably increase it. Well, I mean, there's this hedonistic sex, which is that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple is simple simple simple is simple is simple is simple simple is simple is simple is simple is simple is simple is simple is simple simple is simple is simple simple is simple is simple simple simple simple simple is simple is simple simple simple. It's that's that's that's that's that's to sex is justified. In fact, we should probably increase it. Well, I mean, there's this hedonistic sex, which is, you know, that's near the hittle there. It's not productive. It doesn't produce kids. Well, you know, you\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
