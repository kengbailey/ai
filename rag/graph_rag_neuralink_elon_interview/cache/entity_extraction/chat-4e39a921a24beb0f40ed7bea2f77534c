And vision is back here. Yep. Also on close to the surface. Vision's a little deeper and so you know this gets to your question about how deep can you get. To do vision we can't just do the surface of the brain. We have to be able to go in not not as deep as we have to go for DBS but maybe a centimeter deeper than we're used to for hand insertions. And so that's, you know, work in progress. That's a new set of challenges to overcome. By the way, you mentioned the Utah array, and I just saw a picture and that thing looks terrifying. Yeah, that's nails. It's because it's rigid and then if you look at the threads, they're flexible. What can you say that's interesting to you about the flexible, that kind of approach of the flexible threads to deliver the electrodes next to the neurons? Yeah, I mean the goal there comes from experience. I mean we stand on the shoulders of people that made Utah rays and used Utah rays for decades before we ever even came along. Neurlink arose partly, this approach to technology arose out of a need recognized after Utah rays would fail routinely because the rigid electrodes those spikes that are literally hammered using an air hammer into the brain, those spikes generate a bad immune response that encapsulates the electrode spikes in scar tissue, essentially. And so one of the projects that was being worked on in the Anderson Lab at Caltech, when I got there was to see if you could use chemo-therapy to prevent the formation of scar. It's like, you know, things are pretty bad when you're jamming a bed of nails into the brain and then treating that with chemotherapy to try to prevent scar tissue. It's like, you know, maybe we've gotten off track here guys, maybe there's a fundamental redesign necessary. And so, Neurlink's approach of using highly flexible, tiny electrodes avoids a lot of the bleeding, avoids a lot of the immune response that ends up happening when rigid electrodes are pounded into the brain. And so what we see is our electrode longevity and functionality and the health of the brain tissue immediately surrounding the electrode is excellent. I mean it goes on for for years now in our animal models. What do most people not understand about the biology of the brain? We'll mention the vascular chair, that's really interesting. I think the most interesting, maybe underappreciated fact is that it really does control almost everything. I mean, I don't know, for out of a blue example, imagine you want a lever on fertility. You want to be able to turn fertility on and off. I mean, there are legitimate targets in the brain itself to modulate fertility, say, blood pressure. You want to modulate blood pressure. There are legitimate targets in the brain for doing that. Things that. Things that aren't immediately obvious as brain problems are potentially solvable in the brain. And so I think it's an under-explored area for primary treatments of all the things that bother people. That's a really fascinating way to look at it. There's a lot of conditions we might think have nothing to do with the brain, but they might just be symptoms of something that actually started in the brain. The actual source of the problem, the primary source is something in the brain. Yeah, not always. I mean, you know, their kidney disease is real. But there are there are there are there are the the the their are their their their their their their their kidney disease is real, but there are levers you can pull in the brain that affect all of the, all of these systems. There's knobs. Yeah. On-off switches and knobs in the brain, from which this all originates. Would you have a neural link chip implanted in your brain? Yeah. I think, use case right now is use a mouse, right? I can already do that and so there's no value proposition on safety grounds alone, sure, I'll do it tomorrow. You know, you say the use case of the mouse, because after like researching all this and part of it is just watching Nolan have so much fun. If you can get that bits per second like really high with the mouse, like being able to interact, because if you think about the way the, on the smartphone, the way you swipe, that that was transformational. Yeah. How we interact with the thing. It's subtle. You don't realize but to be able to touch a phone and To scroll with your finger that's like that changed everything that people were sure you need a keyboard to type and the That there's a lot of HCI aspects to that that changed how we interact with computers so there could be a certain certain rate of speed with a mouse that would change everything. It's like you might be able to just click around a screen extremely fast. And that, I don't know, if it, I don't, I guess you must have getting a neural link for much more rapid interaction with digital devices. Yeah, I think recording speech intentions from the brain might change things as well. You know, the value proposition for the average person. A keyboard is a pretty clunky human interface. Requires a lot of training. It's, you know, highly variable in the maximum performance that the average person can achieve. I think taking that out of the equation and just having a natural, you know, word to computer interface might change things for a lot of people. It'd be hilarious if that is the reason people do it. Even if you have speech to text that's extremely accurate, it currently isn't, but it's a gotten super accurate. It'd be hilarious if people\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
