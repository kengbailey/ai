Yeah, so that's all you're thinking about right now. Yeah, I know. I just I just want, I want to do better. At nine. I want to do better. I want to hit nine. I think, well I know nine is very, very achievable. I'm right there. I think 10 I could hit maybe in the next month. Like I could do it probably in the next few weeks if I really push. I think you and Elon are basically the same person, because last time I did a podcast with him, he came in extremely frustrated that he can't beat Uber Lilith as a droid. That was like a year ago, I think I forget, like solo. And I could just tell there's some percentage of his brain, the entire time was thinking, like I wish I was right now attempting. I think he did it that night. He stayed up and did it that night. It's just crazy to me. I mean, in a fundamental way, it's really inspiring. And what you're doing is inspiring that way, because it's not just about the game. Everything you're doing everybody figure out how to create the system all along, like the decoding, the software, the hardware, the calibration, all of it, how to make all of that work so you can do everything else really well. Yeah, it's just really fun. Well, that's also that's part of the thing is making it fun. Yeah, it's addicting. I'm, I've joked about, um, like, what they actually did. thi. th, when. th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th, th. th. th. thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, the their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, th. So, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, their, the thing is making it fun. Yeah, it's addicting. I'm I've joked about like what they actually did when they went in and put this thing in my brain. They must have flipped a switch to make me more susceptible to these kinds of games to make me addicted to like WebGrid or something? Do you know Bliss's high score? Yeah, he said like 14 or something 17.1 or something something I'm doing well 17 out of dot 17.01 yeah, he told me like does it on the floor with peanut butter and he like fast it's is weird that sounds like cheating sounds how good to be at this game and I think you told me right then you're gonna try to beat me. I'm gonna get there someday. Yeah I think I can believe you. I think I think I can. I think for that. Yeah so I've been playing first off with the dwell cursor which really hampers my web the clicks. So you have to, you have to, so you click by Dwally. You said point three. Point three seconds. Which, which sucks. It really slows down how much I'm able to, like how high I'm able to get. I still hit like 50, I think I hit like 50 something trials, net trials per minute in that, which was pretty good, because I'm able to like, there's, one of the settings is also like how slow you need to be moving in order to initiate a click, to start a click, so I can tell sort of when I'm on that threshold to start initiating a click, so I'm not fully stopped over the target when I go to click. I'm doing it like on my way to the targets a little to try to time it just right. Wow, so you're slowing down. Yeah, just a hair right before the targets. This is like a lead performance, oh okay. But that still, it sucks that there's a ceiling of the point three? Well I can get down to point two and point one. Point one's. Yeah, and I've played with that a little bit too. I have to adjust a ton of different parameters in order to play with point one. And I don't have control over all that on my end yet. It also changes like how the models are trained. Like if I train a model like a bootstrap on a model, which basically is them training models as I'm playing web grid based off of like the web grid data that I'm so like if I play web grid for 10 minutes, they can train off that data specifically in order to get me a better model. If I do that with 0.3 versus 0.1, the models come out different. The way that they interact is just much, much different. So I have to be really careful. I found that doing it with 0.3 is actually better in some ways, unless I can do it with 0.1 and change all of the different parameters, then that's more ideal, because obviously 0.3 is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
