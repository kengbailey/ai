And what we've observed and what has also been observed in academic work is that that baseline rate sort of the, if you're trying to scale, if you imagine that analogy for like measuring you know flour or something when you're baking, that baseline measure is how much rice is in the pot, you're going to get a different measurement different days because you're measuring with different pots. So that baseline rate shifting is really the thing that, at least from a first-order description of the problem, is what's the first-order description of the problem, is to the baseline nonstop? Yeah, this is a great question. So with monkeys, we have found various ways to do this. One example I would do this is you ask them to do some behavioral task, like play the game with a joystick. You measure what's going on in the brain. You compute some mean of what's going on across all the game with a joystick, you measure what's going on in the brain, you compute some mean of what's going on across all the input features, and you subtract that in the input when you're doing your BCI session. Works super well. For whatever reason, that doesn't work super well with Nolan. I actually don't know the full reason why, but I can imagine several explanations. One such explanation could be that the context effect difference between some open loop task and some closed-and to to to with Nolan than it is with Monkey. Maybe in this open loop task he's you know watching the Lex Freeman podcast while he's doing the task or he's whistling and listening to music and talking with his friend and ask his mom what's for dinner while he's doing this task. And so the exact sort of difference in context between those two states may be much larger and thus lead to a bigger generalization gap between the features that you're normalizing at, sort of open loop time and what you're trying to use at close loop time. That's interesting. Just on that point, it's kind of incredible to watch Nolan be able  because he's talking from kicking my ass and chest too yeah kicking your ass and now we and talk trash while doing yes so all at the same time and yes if you're trying to normalize to the baseline that might throw everything off boy is that interesting maybe one comment on that too for folks that aren't familiar with assisted technology I think there's a common belief that, you know, well, why can't you just use an eye tracker or something like this for helping somebody move a mouse on the screen? And it's a really a fair question in one that I actually did, was not confident before, Sir Nolan, that this was going  will be, but the reasons are subtle. It really has to do with ergonomically how it fits into their life. Even if you can just offer the same level of control as what they would have with an eye tracker or with a mouse stick, but you don't need to have that thing in your face, you don't need to be positioned in a certain way, you don't need to to the to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to totext a friend at night privately without their mom needing to be in the loop. It means that they can like open up, you know, and browse the internet at 2 a.m. when nobody's around to set their iPad up for them. This is like a profoundly game-changing thing for folks in that situation. And this is even before we start talking about folks that, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, that, that,  be able to communicate at all or ask for help when they want to. This can be the potentially the only link that they have to the outside world. And yeah, that one doesn't, I think, need explanation of why that's so impactful. You mentioned neural decoder. How much machine learning is in the decoder? How much magic, how much science, how much art? How difficult does it to come up with a decoder that figures out what these sequence of spikes mean? Yeah, good question. There's a couple different ways to answer this. So maybe I'll zoom out briefly first and then I'll go down one of the rabbit holes. So the zoomed-out view is that building the decoder is really the process of building the dataset plus compiling it into the weights. And each of those steps is important. The direction I think of further improvement is primarily going to be in the data set side of how do you construct the optimal labels for the model. But there's an entirely separate challenge of then how do you compile it the best model. And so I'll go briefly down the second rabbit hole. One of the main challenges with designing the optimal model for BCI is that offline metrics don't necessarily correspond to online metrics. It's fundamentally a control problem. The user is trying to control something on the screen. And the exact sort of user experience of how you output the intention impacts the ability to control. So for example, if you just look at validation loss, there can be multiple ways to achieve the same validation loss. Not all of them are equally controllable by the end user. And so the, you know, it might be as simple as saying, oh, you can just add auxiliary loss terms that like help you capture the thing that actually matters, but this is a very complex nuance process. is more of a nuanced process than just like a standard supervised learning problem.
