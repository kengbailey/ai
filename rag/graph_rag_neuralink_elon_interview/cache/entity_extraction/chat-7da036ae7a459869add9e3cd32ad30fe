And the next morning in the ICU where he was recovering, he wanted to get started and actually start to understand what kind of signal we can measure from his brain. And maybe for folks who are not familiar with the neural system, we implant the neural ti. the neural ink implant in the motor cortex. So the motor cortex is responsible for representing things like motor intent. So if you imagine closing and opening your hand, that kind of signal representation would be present in the motor cortex. If you imagine moving your arm back and forth or wiggling a pinky, this sort of signal can be present in the motor cortex. So one of the ways we start to sort of map out what kind of signal do we actually have access to in any particular individual's brain is through this task called body mapping. And body mapping is where you essentially present a visual to the user and you say, hey, imagine doing this. And that visual is a 3D hand opening and closing or our index finger modulating up and down. And you ask the user to imagine that. And obviously you can't see them do move their arm. But while they do this task, you can record neural activity. And you can basically offline model and check, can I predict or can I detect the modulation corresponding with those different actions. And so we did that task and we realized, hey, there's actually some modulation associated with some of his hand motion, which is a first indication that, modulation to do useful things in the world. For example, control on computer cursor. And he started playing with it the first time we showed him it. And we actually just took the same live view of his brain activity and put it in front of him. And we said, hey, you tell us what's going on. We're not you. You're able to imagine different things. And we know that it for a bit. He was like, I don't quite get it yet. He played for a bit longer and they said, oh, when I move this finger, I see this particular neuron start to fire more. And I said, okay, prove it, do it again. And so he said, okay, three, two, one. Boom. And the minute he moved, I can tell you the exact channel number if you're interested. It's stuck in my brain now forever. But that single channel firing was a beautiful indication that it was behaved really modulated neural activity that could then be used for downstream tasks like decoding, a computer cursor. And when you say single channel electrode are interchangeable. And there's a 1,024 of those. 1,024, yeah. It's incredible that that works. That really, when I was learning about all this and like loading it in, it was just blowing my mind that the intention you can visualize yourself moving the finger, that can turn into a signal, and the fact that you can then skip that step and visualize the cursor moving or have the intention of the cursor moving in that can turn into a signal. And the fact that you can then skip that step and visualize the cursor moving, or have the intention of the cursor moving and that leading to a signal that can then be used to move the cursor. This, there is so many exciting things there to learn about the brain, about the way the brain works. The very fact of their existing signal that can can can can can can can can can can can that's just like the beginning of figuring out how that signal could be used really, really effectively. I should also just, there's so many fascinating details here, but you mentioned the body mapping step, at least in the version I saw that Nolan was showing off. There's like a super nice interface, like a graphical interface. It just felt like I was like a graphical interface. Like it just felt like I was like in the future because it like you know I guess it visualizes you moving the hand and there's a very like like a sexy polished interface that's like hello. I don't know if there's a voice component but it just felt like it's in like when you wake up in a really nice video game and this is a tutorial at the beginning of that video game yeah this is what you're supposed to do it's cool no I mean the future should feel like the future but it's not easy to pull that off I mean it needs to be simple but not too simple yeah and I think the ux design component here underrated for BCI development in general. There's a whole interaction effect between the ways in which you visualize an instruction to the user and the kinds of signal you can get back. And that quality of sort of your behavioral alignment to the neural signal is a function of how good you are expressing to the user. And so yeah, we spend a lot of time thinking about the UX, of how we build our applications, of how the decoder actually functions, the control surface as it provides to the user. All these little details matter a lot. So maybe it'd be nice to get into a little bit more detail of what the signal looks like and what the decoding looks like. So there's a N1 implant that has, like we mentioned, a 1,024 electrodes, and that's collecting raw data, raw signal. What does that signal look like? And what are the different steps along the way before it's transmitted and what is transmitted, all that kind of stuff? Yeah, yep. This is going to be a fun one. Let's go. So, maybe before diving into what we do, it's worth understanding what we're trying to measure because that dictates a lot of the requirements for the system that we build. And what we're trying to measure is really individual neurons producing action potentials. An action potential is, you can think of it like\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
