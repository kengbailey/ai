But at which point does he no longer visualize the movement of his body and it's just visualizing the movement of the cursor? Yeah. How quickly does it get there? So this happened on a Tuesday. clearly because at some point during the during the day it looked like he wasn't doing super well, it looked like the model wasn't performing super well and he was like getting distracted, but he actually wasn't the case. Like what it was, like abstract intention to move the cursor on the screen. And I cannot tell you what the difference between those two things are. I really truly cannot. He's tried to explain it to me before. I cannot, you know, give a first person account of what that's like. But the expletives that he uttered in that's a way through UX to encourage a human being to discover that because he discovered it like you said to me that he's a pioneer so he discovered that on his own through all this the process of trying to try to move the cursor with different kinds of intentions but that is clearly a really powerful thing to arrive at, which is to let go of trying to control the fingers and the hand and control the actual digital device with your mind. That's right. UX is how it works. The ideal UX is one that it's, the user doesn't have to think about what they need to do in order to get it done. They just, it just does it. That is so fascinating. But I wonder on the biological side, how long it takes for the brain to adapt? Yeah. So is it just simply learning like high-level software, or is there like a neuroplasticity component where like the brain is adjusting slowly? Yeah, the truth is I don't know. I'm very excited to see with sort of the second participant that we implant what the you know what the journey is like for them because we'll have learned a lot more. Potentially we can help them understand and explore that direction more quickly. This is something I didn't, you know this wasn't me prompting Nolan to go try this. He was just exploring how to use his device and figure it out himself. But now that we know that that's a possibility that maybe there's a way to, you know, for example hint the user, don't try super hard during calibration, just do something that feels natural or just directly control the cursor, you know, of operation for them. You don't have to go through this intermediate phase of explicit motions. Or maybe if that naturally happens for people, you can just occasionally encourage them to allow themselves to move the cursor. Actually, sometimes just like with a form in a mile, just the knowledge that that's possible. Pushes you to do it and then it becomes trivial. And then it also makes you wonder, this is the cool thing about humans. Once there's a lot more human participants, they will discover things that are possible. And share their experiences. And that because of them sharing it, they'll be able to do it. All of a sudden that's unlocked for everybody. Because just the knowledge sometimes is the thing that enables it to do it. Yeah, I mean, just coming on that too, like there's, we've tried to try like a thousand different ways to do various aspects of decoding. And now we know like what the right subspace is to continue exploring further. Again, thanks to Nolan or the beam search of different approaches that we could explore really help accelerate for the next person, you know, the set of things that we'll get to try on day one, how fast we hope to get them to useful control, how fast we can enable them to use it independently and to get value of the system. So yeah, massive hats off to Nolan and all the participants that came before him to reality. So how often are the updates to the decoder? Because Nolan mentioned like, okay, there's a new update that we're working on and that in the stream he said he plays the snake game because it's like super hard. It's a good way for him to test like how good the update is. So and he says like sometimes the update is a step backwards. So it's a constant like iteration. So how often like what does the update entail? Is it most on the decoder side? Yeah, a couple of comments. So one is it's probably worth trying distinction between sort of research sessions where we're actively trying different things to understand like what the best approach is versus sort of independent use where we want to have ability to just go use a device how anybody would want to use their MacBook. And so what he's referring to is, I think, usually in the context of a research session, where we're trying, you know, many, many different approaches to, you know, even unsupervised approaches like we talked about earlier, to try to come up with better ways to estimate his true intention and more accurately decode in. And in those scenarios, I mean, we try in that day, like a lot of different things. Now, it's also worth noting that we update the application he uses quite frequently. I think, you know, sometimes up to like four or five times a day, we'll update his application with different features or bug fixes or feedback that he's the thi's given us. He's been able to, he's a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very. He's a very very very very very very very. He's a very very very very very very very very very very very very articulate, he's a very articulate, he's a very articulate\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
