I work with the user basically every day to develop new UX paradigms, decoding strategies. And I was part of the team that figured out how to recover useful BCI to new world record levels when the signal quality degraded. We'll talk about I think every aspect of that, but just zooming out, what was it like to be part of that, part of that team and part of that historic, I would say, historic first. Yeah, I think for me this is something I've been excited about for close to 10 years now and so to be able to be even just some small part of making it a reality is extremely exciting. A couple maybe special moments during that whole process that I'll never really truly forget. One of them is entering the actual surgery, you know, at that point in time, I know Nolan quite well. I know his family. And so I think the initial reaction when Nolan is rolled into the operating room is just a, oh shit kind of reaction. But at that point, muscle memory kicks in and you sort of go into, you let your body just do all the talking. And I have the lucky job in that particular procedure to just be in charge of monitoring the implant. So my job is to sit there to look at the signals coming off the implant, to look at the live brain data, streaming off the device as threads are being inserted into the brain. And just to basically observe and make sure that nothing is going wrong or that there's no red flags or fault conditions that we need to go spectator view of the surgery, I had a slightly removed perspective and I think most folks in the room, I got to sit there and think to myself, wow, you know, that brain is moving a lot. You know, when you look into the side little cranectomy that we stick the threads in, you know, one thing that most people don't realize is the brain moves. The brain moves a lot th when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when when you breathe, when your heart beats, and you can see it visibly. So, you know, that's something that I think was a surprise to me and very, very exciting to be able to see someone's brain who you physically know, and I've talked with that length actually pulsing and moving inside their skull. And they used that brain to talk to you previously, and now it's right there moving. Yeah. Actually, I didn't realize that in that in that in that in that in that in that in that in that in that in that in that in that in terms of the thread sending, so the neural link implant is active during surgery, so in one thread at a time, you're able to start seeing the signal. Yeah, so that's part of the way you test that the thing is working. Yeah, so actually in the operating room, right after we sort of finished all the threat insertions, I started collecting what's called broadband data. So broadband is basically the most raw form of signal you can collect from a neural electrode. It's essentially a measurement of the local field potential or the, yeah, the voltage essentially measured by that electrode. And we have a certain mode in our application that allows us to visualize where detected spikes are. So it visualizes sort of where in the broadband signal, and it's very, very raw form of the data, a neuron is actually spiking. And so one of these moments that I'll never forget as part of this whole clinical trial is seeing live in the operating room, while he's still under anesthesia, beautiful spikes being shown in the application, just streaming in my hand. So this is no signal processing the raw data and then the signal processing is on top of it you're seeing the spikes detected. Right, yeah. And that's a UX2. Yes. That looks beautiful as well. During that procedure there was actually a lot of cameramen in the room so they also were curious and wanted to see there's several neurosurgeons in the room who are all just excited to see robots taking their job and they're all you know crowded around a small little iPhone watching this live brain data stream out of his brain. What was that like seeing the robot do some of the surgery so the computer vision aspect where it detects all the all the spots that avoid the blood vessels and then obviously with human supervision then actually doing the blood vessels and then obviously with human supervision then actually doing the really high precision connection of the threads to the brain. Yeah, it's a good question. My answer is going to be pretty lame here but it was boring. Yeah. I've seen it so many times. Yeah, I've seen it so many times. I've seen the the robot do the surgery Literally hundreds of times and so it was just one more time. Yeah All the practice surgeries and the prox not move the cursor, but get signal from the brain such that it was able to show that there's a connection. Yeah, yeah, so we are quite excited to move as quickly as we can and Nolan was really really excited to get started. He wanted to get started actually the day of surgery, but we waited till the next morning, very patiently, it's a long night. And the next morning in the ICU where he was recovering, he wanted to get started and actually start to understand what kind of signal we can measure from his brain. And maybe for folks who are not familiar with the neural system, we implant the neural ti. the neural ink implant in the motor cortex. So the motor cortex is responsible for representing things like motor intent. So if you imagine closing and opening your hand, that kind of signal representation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
