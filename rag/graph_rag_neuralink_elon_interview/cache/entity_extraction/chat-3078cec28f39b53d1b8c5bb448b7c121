I don't know what it is about us humans. We want to think about the worst possible thing. We love drama. It's like how is this new technology going to kill everybody? We just love that. Hopefully people don't think about that too much with me. It'll ruin a lot of my plans. Yeah, I assume you're going to have to take all the world. I mean, I love your Twitter. You tweeted, I'd like to make jokes about hearing voices in my head since getting the neural link, but I feel like people would take it the wrong way, plus the voices in my head told me not to. Yeah. Yeah. Please never stop. So you're talking about Optimus. So you're talking about Optimus. Is that something you would love to be able to do to do to do a a the entirety of optimist? Oh yeah for sure, for sure, absolutely. You think there's something like fundamentally different about just being able to physically interact with the world? Yeah, oh a hundred percent. This, I know another thing with like being able to like give people the ability like feel sensation and stuff to you by going in with the brain and having the neural like maybe do that. That could be something that could be translated through, transferred through the optimist as well. Like, there's all sorts of really cool interplay between that, and then also, like I said, just physically interacting. I mean, 99% of the things that I can't do myself obviously need, I need a caretaker for someone to physically do things for me. If an optimist robot could do that, like I could live an incredibly independent life and not be such a burden on those around me. And that would, it would change the way people like me live, at least until whatever this is gets cured. But being able to interact with the world physically like that would just be amazing. And they're not just like, for having to be a caretaker or something, but something like I talked about, just being able to read a book. I imagine an optimist robot just being able to hold a book open in front of me, like get that smell again. I might not be able to feel it at that point, or maybe I could again with the sensation and stuff, but being there's something different about reading like a physical book than staring at a screen or listening to an audio book. I actually don't like audio books. I've listened to a ton of them at this point, but I don't really like them. I would much rather like read a physical coffee. So one of the things you would love to be able to experience is opening the book, bringing it up to you and to feel the touch of the paper. Yeah, oh man, the touch, the smell, I mean it's just, like just something about the words on the page and you know they've they've replicated, you know that page color on like the Kindle and stuff. Yeah, it's just not the same. Yeah, so just of a lot of things that I interact within the world, like clothes or literally any physical thing that I interact within the world, a lot of times what people around me will do is they'll just come like rub it on my face. They'll like lay something on me so I can feel the weight. They will rub, you know, a shirt on me so I can feel fabric. Like there's something very profound about touch and it is, it's something that I miss a lot and something I would love to do again. We'll see. What would be the first thing you do with a with a hand that can touch? Your mom a hug after that, right? Yeah, yeah, I know that's, it's one thing that I've asked like God for basically every day since my accident was just being able to like one day move, even if it was only like my hand, so that way I could squeeze my mom's hand or something, just to like show her that, you know, like how much I care and how much I love her and everything. Something along those lines, being able to just interact with the people around me, handshake, give someone a hug, I don't know, anything like that, being able to help me eat, like, I'd probably get really fat, which would be a terrible, terrible thing. Also beat Bliss and chess on a physical chessboard. Yeah, yeah, I mean there are just so many upsides, you know? Any way to find some way to feel like I'm bringing Bliss down to my level. Yeah. Because he's just such an amazing guy and everything about him is just so above and beyond that anything I can do to take him down a notch. Yeah, humble him a bit. He needs it. Yeah. Okay, as he's sitting next to me, did you ever make sense of why God puts good people through such hardship? Oh, man. Oh, man. I think it's all about understanding how much we need God. And I don't think that there's any light without the dark. I think that if all of us were happy all the time, there would be, you know, no reason to turn to God ever. I feel like there would be no concept of, you know, good or bad. And I think that as much of, like the darkness and the evil that's in the world, it makes us all appreciate the good and the  that's in the world, it makes us all appreciate the good and the things we have so much more. And I think, you know, like when I had my accident, the first, one of the first things I said to one of my best friends was, and this was within like\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
