I mean, that kind of, that rapid iteration. Yeah, you'll at least be a member of a winning team. Ride the wave. What did you learn? You mentioned there's a lot of amazing neurosurgeons at USC. What lessons about surgery and life have you learned from those folks? Yeah, I think working your ass off, working hard, while, you know, functioning as a member of a team, getting a job done that is incredibly difficult. You know, working incredibly long hours, being up all night, taking care of someone that, you know, you think probably won't survive no matter what you do, working hard to make people that you passionately dislike look good the next morning. These folks were relentless in their pursuit of excellent neurosurgical technique decade over decade, and I think were well recognized for that excellence, so especially Marty Weiss, Steve Giannazo, Mike Apnazo, they made huge contributions not only to surgical technique, but they built training programs that trained dozens or hundreds of amazing neurosurgeons. I was just lucky to kind of be in their wake. What's that like you mentioned doing a surgery where the person is likely not to survive? Does that wear on you? Yeah. Um... You know, it's especially challenging when you, with all respect to our elders, it doesn't hit so much when you're taking care of an 80-year-old and something was going to get them pretty soon anyway. And so you lose a patient like that and it was part of the natural course of what is expected of them in the in the coming years regardless. Taking care of, you know, a father of two or three, four young kids, someone in their 30s that didn't have it coming. And they show up in your ER having their first seizure of their life. And lo and old, they've got a huge malignant, inoperable or incurable brain tumor. You can only do that, I think, a handful of times before it really starts eating away at your armor. Or a young mother that shows up that has a giant hemorrhage in her brain that she's not going to survive from. And, you know, they bring her four-year-old daughter in to say goodbye one last time before they turn the ventilator off. You know, the great Henry Marsh is an English neurosurgeon who said it best. I think he says every neurosurgeon carries with them a private graveyard, and I definitely feel that. Especially with young parents, that kills me. They had a lot more to give. The loss of those people specifically has a knock-on effect that's going to make the world worse for people for a long time. And it's just hard to feel powerless in the face of that. You know and that's where I think you have to be borderline evil to fight against a company like Neurolink or to constantly be taking pot shots at us because what we're doing is to try to fix that stuff. We're trying to give people options to reduce suffering. We're trying to take the pain out of life that broken brains brings in and Yeah, this is just our little way that we're fighting back against entropy, I guess. Yeah, the amount of suffering that's endured when some of the things that we take for granted that our brain is able to do is taken away is immense and to be able to restore some of that functionality is a real gift. Yeah, we're just starting. We're gonna we're gonna do so much more. Well can you take me through the full procedure for implanting, say the N1 chip and your link? Yeah, it's a really simple, really simple, straightforward procedure. The human part of the surgery that I do is dead simple. It's one of the most basic neurosurgery procedures imaginable, and I think there's evidence that it, some version of it, has been done for thousands of years. That there are examples, I think, from ancient Egypt of healed or partially healed trephinations and from Peru or ancient times in South America, where these proto-surgeons would drill holes in people's skulls, presumably to let out the evil spirits, but maybe to drain blood clots. And there's evidence of bone healing around the edge, meaning the people at least survive some months after a procedure. And so what we're doing is that. We are making a cut in the skin on the top of the head over the area of the brain that is the most potent representation of hand intentions. And so if you if you are an expert concert pianist, you know, this part of your brain is lighting up the entire time you're playing, we call it the hand knob. The hand knob. Yeah, it's all the like the finger movements, all this, all of that is just firing away. Yep. There's a little squiggle in the cortex right there. One of the folds in the brain is kind of doubly folded right on that spot. And so you can look at it on an MRI and say, that's the hand knob. And then you do a functional test and a special kind of MRI called a functional MRI, and this part of the brain lights up when people, even quadriplegic people whose brains aren't connected to their finger movements anymore, they imagine finger movements and this part of the brain still lights up. So we can ID that part of the brain in anyone who's preparing to enter our trial and say, okay, that part of the brain, we confirm is your hand in tension area. And so I'll make a little cut in the skin. We'll flap the skin open, just like kind of opening the hood of a car, only a lot smaller. Make a perfectly round, one inch diameter hole in the skull. Remove that bit of skull\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>USC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USC is a university known for having a lot of amazing neurosurgeons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTY WEISS<|>PERSON<|>Marty Weiss is a neurosurgeon recognized for his contributions to surgical technique and training programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVE GIANNAZO<|>PERSON<|>Steve Giannazo is a neurosurgeon recognized for his contributions to surgical technique and training programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKE APNAZO<|>PERSON<|>Mike Apnazo is a neurosurgeon recognized for his contributions to surgical technique and training programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENRY MARSH<|>PERSON<|>Henry Marsh is an English neurosurgeon known for his statement about neurosurgeons carrying a private graveyard)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEUROLINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neurolink is a company working to reduce suffering by fixing brain-related issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N1 CHIP<|>EVENT<|>The N1 chip is a device implanted in the brain to restore functionality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANCIENT EGYPT<|>GEO<|>Ancient Egypt is a historical region where early forms of neurosurgery, such as trephination, were practiced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERU<|>GEO<|>Peru is a country in South America where ancient forms of neurosurgery, such as trephination, were practiced)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARTY WEISS<|>USC<|>Marty Weiss is a neurosurgeon at USC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVE GIANNAZO<|>USC<|>Steve Giannazo is a neurosurgeon at USC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIKE APNAZO<|>USC<|>Mike Apnazo is a neurosurgeon at USC<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENRY MARSH<|>NEUROLINK<|>Henry Marsh's philosophy on neurosurgery aligns with Neurolink's mission to reduce suffering<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N1 CHIP<|>NEUROLINK<|>The N1 chip is a product developed by Neurolink<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANCIENT EGYPT<|>N1 CHIP<|>The N1 chip procedure is compared to ancient neurosurgical practices in Ancient Egypt<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERU<|>N1 CHIP<|>The N1 chip procedure is compared to ancient neurosurgical practices in Peru<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
