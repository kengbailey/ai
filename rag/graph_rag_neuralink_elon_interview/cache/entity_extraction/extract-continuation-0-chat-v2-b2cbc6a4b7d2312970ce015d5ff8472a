So that was a bottleneck for a while. It's just sort of like the software stack itself. If I were to guess right now, there's sort of two major directions you could think about for improving BPS further. The first major direction is labeling. So labeling is again this fundamental challenge of given a window of time where the user is expressing some behavioral intent, what are they really trying to do at the granularity of every millisecond. And that again is a task design problem, it's a UX problem, it's a machine learning problem, it's a software problem, sort of touches all those different domains. The second thing you can think about to improve BPS further is either completely changing the thing you're decoding or just extending the number of things that you're decoding. So this is serving the direction of functionality. Basically you can imagine giving more clicks. For example, a left click, a right click, a middle click, different actions like click and drag for example, and that can improverying to allow the user to express themselves through any given communication channel, you can measure that with base per second, but what actually measures the end of the day is how effective are they at navigating their computer. And so from the perspective of the downstream tasks that their computer, and so from the perspective of the downstream of the down. toecki and their tasks, to to that the user has and the skill and efficiency with which they can operate their computer. Would the number of threads increasing also potentially help? Yes, short answer is yes. It's a bit nuanced how that curve or how that manifests in the numbers. So what you'll see is that if you sort of plot a curve of number of channels that you're using for decode versus either the offline metric of how good you are decoding. What you'll see is that if you sort of plot a curve of number of channels that you're using for decode, versus either the offline metric of how good you are decoding, or the online metric of sort of in practice how good is the user using this device, you see roughly a log curve. So as you move further out in number of channels, you get a corresponding sort of a logarithmic improvement in control quality and offline validation metrics. The important nuance here is that each channel corresponds with a specific, you know, represented intention in the brain. So for example, if you have a channel 254, it might correspond with moving to the right. Channel 256 might be moved to the left. If you want to expand the number of functions you want to control, you really want to have a broader set of channels that covers a broader set of imagined movements. You can think of it like, kind of like Mr. Potatoman, actually. Like if you had a bunch of different imagined movements you could do, how would you map those imagined movements to input to a computer? You could imagine handwriting, to output characters on the screen. You can imagine a different finger modulations for fingers and have that output text on the screen. You can imagine different finger modulations for different clicks. You can imagine wiggling your big nose for opening some menu or wiggling your big toe to have like command tab occur or something like this. So it's really, the amount of different actions you can take in the world depends on how many channels's more about the number of actions. So actually, as you increase the number of threads, that's more about increasing the number of actions you're able to perform. One other nuance there, that is worth mentioning. So again, our goal is really to enable a user-worth paralysis to control the computer as fast as I can, so that's BPS with all the same functionality I have, which is what we just talked about, but then also as reliably as I can. And that last point is very related to channel count discussion. So as you scale out a number of channels, the relative importance of any particular feature of your model input to the output control of the user diminishes, which means that if the neural non-stationary effect is per channel, or if the noise is independent, such that more channels means on average less output effect, then your reliability of your system will improve. So one sort of core thesis that at scale in channel count should improve the reliability system without any work on the decoder itself. Can you linger on reliability here? So first of all, when you see a non-stationarity of the signal, which aspect are you referring to? Yeah, so maybe let's talk briefly what the actual underlying signal looks like. So again, I spoke very briefly at the beginning about how when you imagine moving to the right or imagine moving to the left, neurons might fire more or less. And the frequency content of that signal, atask what the user is doing. You can imagine, actually, this is not obvious that rate coding, which is the name of that phenomenon is like the only way the brain could represent information. You can imagine many different ways in which the brain could encode intention. And there's actually evidence, for example, that there's temporal codes, so the timing of information representation. But at least in the motor cortex, there's substantial evidence that it's rate coding, or at least one, like first order effect is that it's rate coding. So then if the brain is representing information by changing the sort of frequency of a neuron, what really matters is sort of the delta between sort of the baseline state of the neuron, and what it looks like when it's modulated. And what we've observed and what has also been observed in academic work is that that baseline rate sort of the, if you're trying to scale, if you imagine that analogy for like measuring you know flour or something when you're baking, that baseline measure is how much rice is in the pot, you're going to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BPS is a system or software stack that measures user behavior and intent at a granular level, often used for improving user interaction with computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
