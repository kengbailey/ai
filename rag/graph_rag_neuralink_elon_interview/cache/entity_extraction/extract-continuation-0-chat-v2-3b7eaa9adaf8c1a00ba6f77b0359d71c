So is the currently the bottleneck the communication, so like the Bluetooth communication, is that what's the actual bottleneck? I mean there's always going to be a bottleneck, what's the current bolenake? Yeah, a couple things. So kind of hilariously, Bluetooth low-energy protocol has some restrictions on how fast you can communicate. So the protocol itself establishes a standard of, you know, the most frequent sort of updates you can send are on the order of 7.5 milliseconds. And as we push latency down to the level of individual spikes, impacting control, that level of resolution, that kind of protocol is going to become a limiting factor at some scale. Another sort of important nuance to this is that it's not just the Neurlink itself that's part of this equation. If you start pushing latency sort of below the level of how fast screen to refresh, then you have another problem. You need your whole system to be able to be as reactive as the sort of limits of what the technology can offer. Like you need the screen, like 120 hertz just doesn't, you know, work anymore if you're trying to have something to respond at something that's, you know, at the level of one millisecond. That's a really cool challenge. I also like that for a t-shirt. The best mouse in the world. Tell out what the spikes are, we got them all together, now we're sending that over to the app. What's the decoding step look like? Yeah. So maybe first what is decoding? I think there's probably a lot of folks listening that just have no clue what what it device that has an app installed. Yep. So maybe can you tell me at high level what the app is, what the software is outside of the brain? Yeah. So maybe working backwards from the goal, the goal is to help someone with paralysis, in this case, Nolan, be able to navigate his computer independently. And we think the best way to do that is to offer them the same tools to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to navigate to able to navigate his computer independently. And we think the best way to do that is to offer them the same tools that we have to navigate our software because we don't want to have to rebuild an entire software ecosystem for the brain, at least not yet. Maybe someday, you can imagine, there's UXs that are built native for BCI, but in terms of what's useful for people today. I think most people would prefer to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be. to be. to be. the applications that they want to use for their daily jobs, for communicating with their friends, etc. And so the job of the application is really to translate this wireless stream of brain data coming off the implant into control of the computer. And we do that by essentially building a mapping from brain activity to sort of the HID inputs, thethe actual hardware. So HID is just the protocol for communicating input device events. So for example, move mouse to this position or press this key down. And so that mapping is fundamentally what the app is responsible for. But there's a lot of nuance of how that mapping works that we spend a lot of time to try to get right. And we're still in the early stages of a long journey to figure out how to do to do th and to do that optimally. So one part of that process is decoding. So decoding is this process of taking the statistical patterns of brain data that's being channeled across this Bluetooth connection to the application and turning it into, for example, a mouse movement. And that decoding step, you can think of it in a couple different parts. So similar to any machine learning problem, there's a training step. The training step in our in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in, in, in, in, in our intricate behavioral process where the user has to imagine doing different actions. So for example, they'll be presented a screen with a cursor on it and they'll be asked to push that cursor to the right. Then imagine pushing that cursor to the left, push it up, push it down. We can basically build up a pattern or using any sort of modern ML method of mapping of given this brain data and that imagined behavior map one to the other. And then at test time you take that same pattern matching system. In our case it's a deep neural network and you run it and you take the live stream of brain data coming off their implant, you decode it by pattern matching to what you saw at calibration time and you use that for a control of the computer. Now a couple like sort of rabbit holes that I think are quite interesting, one of them has to do with how you build that best template matching system, because there's a variety of behavioral challenges and also debugging challenges when you're working with someone who's paralyzed. Because again, fundamentally, you don't observe what they're trying to do. You can't see them attempt to instruct the user to do something and validate that they're doing it correctly, such that then you can downstream build with confidence the mapping between the neural spikes and the intended action. And by doing the action correctly, what I really mean is at the level of resolution of what neurons are doing. So if in ideal world, you could get a signal of behavioral intent that is ground truth accurate at the scale of sort of one millisecond resolution, then\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a company developing brain-computer interface technology to help people with paralysis navigate their computers independently)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>Nolan is a person with paralysis who is being helped by Neuralink's technology to navigate his computer independently)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUETOOTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data over short distances, which is a bottleneck in Neuralink's communication protocol)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HID (Human Interface Device) is a protocol for communicating input device events, such as mouse movements or key presses, which Neuralink's application uses to control the computer)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>NOLAN<|>Neuralink is developing technology to help Nolan navigate his computer independently<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>BLUETOOTH<|>Neuralink uses Bluetooth for wireless communication of brain data, but it faces limitations due to Bluetooth's protocol<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>HID<|>Neuralink's application translates brain data into HID inputs to control the computer<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
