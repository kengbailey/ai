And that I hope they work really, really hard because it's not just for us. It's for everyone that comes after us. And, you know, come to me if they need anything, and to go to Neurlink if they need anything, man, Neurlink moves mountains. Like, they do absolutely anything for me that they can. And it's an amazing support system to have. It puts my mind at ease for like so many things that I have had questions about, so many things I want to do, and they're always there, and that's really, really nice. And so I would tell them not to be afraid to go to Neurlink with any questions that they have, any concerns, anything that they're looking to do with this and any help that Neuralink is capable of providing I know they will and I don't know I don't know just work your ass off because it's it's really important that we try to give our all to this. So have fun and work hard. Yeah yeah there we go maybe that's what I'll just start saying to people. Have fun, work hard. Now you're a real pro-athlete, just keep it short. Maybe it's good to talk about what you've been able to do now that you have a neural link implant, like the freedom you gain from this way of interacting with the outside world. Like you play video games all night of interacting with the outside world. Like you play video games all night and you do that by yourself. And that's a kind of freedom. Can you speak to that freedom that you gain? Yeah, it's what all, I don't know, people in my position want. They just want more independence. The more load that I can take away from people around me, the better. If I'm able to interact with the world without using my family, without going through any of my friends, like needing them to help me with things, the better. If I'm able to sit up on my computer all night and not need someone to sit me up, say on my iPad, like in a position where I can use it and then have to have them wait up for me all night until I'm ready to be done using it like that it takes a load off of all of us and it's it's really like all I can ask for it's something that you know I could never think Neurlink enough for and I know my family feels the same way. You know, just being able to have the freedom to do things on my own at any hour of the day or night, it means the world to me, and I don't know. When you're up at 2 a.m. playing web grid, by yourself, I just imagine like it's darkness and there's just a light glowing, and you're just focused. What's going through your mind? Or you're like in a state of flow where it's like the mind, like those like Zen masters? Yeah. Generally it is me playing music of some sort. I have a massive playlist and so I'm just like rocking out to music. And then it's also just like a race against time because I'm constantly looking at how much battery percentage I have left on my implant. Like, all right, I have 30% which equates to, you know, X amount of time, which means I have to break this record in the next, you know, hour and a half or else it's not happening tonight. And so it's a little stressful when that happens. When it's like, when it's above 50%, I'm like, okay, like, I got time. It's getting down to 30 and then 20. It's like all right 10% a little pop-ups gonna pop-up right here and it's gonna really screw my web grid flow. It's gonna tell me that you know like there's a like the low battery. Low or else that pop-ups going to get in the way, like cover my web grid. And then it, after that I go click on it, go back into webgrid and I'm like, all right, that means I have, you know, 10 minutes left before this thing's dead. That's what's going on in my head, generally that and whatever songs playing. And I just, I just want to break tho tho tho tho tho tho tho tho tho tho tho tho tho. tho. tho. tho. their th records so bad. Like it's all I want when I'm playing webgrid. It has become less of like, oh, this is just a leisurely activity. Like, I just enjoy doing this because it just feels so nice and it puts me at ease. It is no, once I'm in web grid, you better break this record or you're gonna waste like five hours of your life right now. And I don't know, it's just fun. It's fun, man. Have you ever tried web grid with like two targets and three targets? Can you get higher BPS with that? Can you do that? You mean like different targets? Or you being... Oh, get multiple targets? Yes. That changed the thing of like different clicks as basically double in the number of active targets. Got it. So you know, you basically higher BPS the more options that are the more difficult to task. And there's also like Zen mode you've played in before which is like infinite. Yeah. It covers it covers the whole screen with a grid and I don't know. What? Yeah. And so you can go like, that's insane. Yeah. He doesn't like it because it didn't show BPS. So like, you know, oh yeah.
