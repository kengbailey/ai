And you know we care about being compliant with whatever regulations are in front of us but I think more important than that people want to give all give their all in becoming a better neurosurgeon because the stakes are so high and so it's a real fight to get residents to say go home at the end of the the stakes are so high and so it's a real fight to get residents to say go home at the end of their shift and not stay and do more surgery. Are you seriously saying like one of the hardest things is literally like getting forcing them to get sleep and rest and all this kind of stuff. Historically that was the case I think I think the next generation I think the next generation I think the next generation is more compliant and more self-care. We care what you mean all I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I didn't say it now I'm making enemies no okay I get it well that's fascinating so what was the second thing the personalities and maybe the two are connected but so is it was a pretty competitive it's competitive? It's competitive and it's also, you know, as we touched on earlier, primates like power. And I think neurosurgery has long had this aura of mystique and excellence and whatever about it. And so it's an invitation, I think, for people that are cloaked in that authority. You know, a board-certified neurosurgeon is basically a walking fallacious appeal to authority, right? You have license to walk into any room and act like you're, you know, an expert on whatever. And fighting that tendency is not something that most neurosurgeons do well. Humility isn't the forte. Yeah, one of the, so I have friends who know you and whenever they speak a while you, that yours, you have the surprising quality for a neurosurgeon of humility, which I think indicates that it's not, it's not as common as perhaps in other professions. Because there is a kind of gigantic sort of heroic aspect to neurosurgery and I think it gets to people's head a little bit. Yeah. Well that I think that, you know, that allows me to play well at an Elon company because Elon, one of his strengths I think is to just instantly see through fallacy from authority. So nobody walks into a room that he's in and says, well, God damn it, you have to trust me. I'm the guy that built the last, you know, ten rockets or something. And he says, well, you did it wrong and we can do it better. Or I'm the guy that, you know, kept Ford alive for the last 50 years. You listen to me on how to build cars and he says, no. And so you don't walk into a room that he's in and say, well, I'm a neurosurgeon, let me tell you how to do it. He's going to say, well, I'm a human being that has a brain I can think from first principles myself, thank you very much. And here's how I think it ought to be done. Let's go try it and see who's right. And that's proven, I think, over and over in his case to be a very powerful approach. If we just take that tangent, there's a fascinating interdisciplinary team at Neurlink that you get to interact with, including Elon. What do you think is the secret to a successful team? What have you learned from just getting to observe these folks? Yeah. World experts in different disciplines work together. Yeah, there's a sweet spot where people disagree and forcefully speak their mind and passionately defend their position and yet are still able to accept information from others and change their ideas when they're wrong. And so I like the analogy of sort of how you polish rocks. You put hard things in a hard container and spin it. People bash against each other and outcomes, you know, a more refined product. And so to make a good team at Neurlink, we've tried to find, you know, people that are not afraid to defend their ideas passionately and, you know've tried to find, you know, people that are not afraid to defend their ideas passionately and, you know, occasionally strongly disagree with people that they're, that they're working with and have the best idea come out on top. It's not an easy balance, again, to refer back to the primate brain. It's not something that is inherently built into the primate brain to say, I passionately put all my chips on this position and now I'm just going to walk away from it, admit you are right. You know, part of our brains tell us that that is a power loss, that is a loss of face, a loss of standing in the community, and now you're a Zeta chump, because your idea got trounced. And you just have to, you know, recognize that that little voice in the back of your head is maladaptive and it's not helping the team win. Yeah, you have to have the confidence to be able to walk away from an idea that you hold on to. Yeah. And if you do that often enough, you're actually going to become the best in the world that you're thinking. I mean, that kind of, that rapid iteration. Yeah, you'll at least be a member of a winning team. Ride the wave. What did you learn? You mentioned there's a lot of amazing neurosurgeons at USC. What lessons about surgery and life have you learned from those folks? Yeah, I think working your ass off, working hard, while, you know, functioning as a member of a team, getting a job done that is incredibly difficult.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a company that focuses on developing brain-machine interface technology, involving an interdisciplinary team of world experts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELON<|>PERSON<|>Elon Musk is a prominent entrepreneur known for his work with companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Southern California (USC) is an educational institution known for its medical and neurosurgery programs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ELON<|>Elon Musk is involved with Neuralink and contributes to its interdisciplinary team<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>USC<|>Neuralink employs neurosurgeons who have learned valuable lessons from their time at USC<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
