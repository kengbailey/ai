I have about 10, 10 or 12 from high school that have all stuck around and we still get together all of us twice a year. We call it the Spring Series and the fall series. This last one we all did, we dressed up like X-Men, so I did a Professor Xavier, and it was freaking awesome. It was so good. So yeah, I have such a great support system around me, and so, you know, being a quadrilegic isn't that bad. I get weighted on all the time. People bring me food and drinks and I get to sit around and watch as much TV and movies and anime as I want. I get to read as much as I want. I mean, it's great. It's beautiful to see that you see the silver lining in all of this. I was just going back, do you remember the moment when you first realized you're paralyzed from the neck down. Yep. I was face down in the water. Right when I, whatever, something had my head, I tried to get up and I realized I couldn't move and it just sort of clicked. I'm like, all right, I'm paralyzed, can't move, what do I do? If I can't get up, I can't flip over, can't do anything, then I'm going to drown eventually. And I knew I couldn't hold my breath forever. So I just held my breath and thought about it for maybe 10, 15 seconds. I've heard from other people that, like, on liquors, I guess, the two girls that pulled me out of the water were two of my best friends, they are lifeguards. And one of them said that it looked like my body was sort of shaking in the water, like I was trying to flip over and stuff. But I knew, I knew immediately, and I just kind of, I realized that that's what my situation was from here on out. Maybe if I got to the hospital, they'd be able to do something. When I was in the hospital, like right before surgery, I was trying to calm one of my friends down. I had like brought her with me from college to camp, and she was just bawling over me and I was like, hey, it's going to be fine like don't worry I was cracking some jokes to try to lighten the mood the nurse had called my mom and I was like don't tell my mom she's just going to be stressed out call her after I'm out of surgery because at least she'll have some answers then like whether I live or not really and I didn't want her to be stressed through the whole thing. But I knew. And then when I first woke up after surgery, I was super drugged up. They had me on fentanyl like three ways, which was awesome. I don't recommend it, but I saw some crazy stuff on that fentanyl, and it was still the best I've ever felt on drugs. Medication, sorry, on medication. And I remember the first time I saw my mom in the hospital, I was just bawling. I had like ventilator in, like I couldn't talk or anything, and I just started crying because it was more like seeing her. Not that, I mean, the whole situation obviously was pretty rough, but I was just like seeing her face for the first time was pretty hard. But yeah, I just, I never had like a moment of, you know, man, I'm paralyzed. This sucks. I don't want to like be around anymore. It was always man, I'm paralyzed, this sucks, I don't want to like be around anymore. It was always just, I hate that I have to do this, but like sitting here and wallowing isn't going to help. So immediate acceptance? Yeah. Yeah. Has there been low points along the way? Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, there are days when I don't really feel like doing anything. Not so much anymore, like not for the last couple years. I don't really feel that way. I've more so just wanted to try to do anything possible to make my life better at this point. But at the beginning, there were some ups and downs. There were some really hard things to adjust to to to to do anything possible to make my life better at this point. But at the beginning, there were some ups and downs. There were some really hard things to adjust to. First off, just like the first couple months, the amount of pain I was in was really, really hard. I mean, I remember screaming at the top of my lungs in the hospital because I thought my legs were on fire and obviously I can't feel anything but it's all nerve pain and so that was a really hard night. I asked them to give me as much pain meds as possible. They're like you've had as much as you can have so just kind of deal with it, go to a happy place sort of thing. So that was a pretty low point. And then every now and again it's hard like realizing things that I wanted to do in my life that I won't be able to do anymore. You know, I always wanted to be a husband and father and I just don't think that I could do it now as a quadriplegic. Maybe it's possible, but I'm not sure I would ever put, you know, someone I love through that, like having to take care of me and stuff. Not being able to go out and play sports. I was a huge athlete growing up, so that was pretty hard. Little things do when I realize I can't\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPRING SERIES<|>EVENT<|>A biannual event where the speaker and their high school friends get together)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALL SERIES<|>EVENT<|>A biannual event where the speaker and their high school friends get together)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>X-MEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A fictional team of superheroes from Marvel Comics that the speaker and their friends dressed up as during their last gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR XAVIER<|>PERSON<|>A character from the X-Men series that the speaker dressed up as during their last gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The medical facility where the speaker was treated after their accident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FENTANYL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful opioid medication that the speaker was administered in the hospital)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOM<|>PERSON<|>The speaker's mother who was called by the nurse before the speaker's surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NURSE<|>PERSON<|>The medical professional who called the speaker's mother before the surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The educational institution where the speaker and one of their friends attended before the accident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMP<|>GEO<|>The location where the speaker and their friend were before the accident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEST FRIENDS<|>PERSON<|>Two of the speaker's best friends who pulled them out of the water after the accident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIFEGUARDS<|>PERSON<|>The role of the two best friends who pulled the speaker out of the water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUADRIPLEGIC<|>PERSON<|>The condition of the speaker, being paralyzed from the neck down)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANIME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A genre of animated entertainment that the speaker enjoys watching)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medium of entertainment that the speaker enjoys watching)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOVIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medium of entertainment that the speaker enjoys watching)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURGERY<|>EVENT<|>The medical procedure the speaker underwent after their accident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENTILATOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medical device that the speaker was on after their surgery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAIN MEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Medications administered to the speaker to manage pain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUSBAND<|>PERSON<|>A role the speaker aspired to but feels may be difficult to achieve as a quadriplegic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FATHER<|>PERSON<|>A role the speaker aspired to but feels may be difficult to achieve as a quadriplegic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATHLETE<|>PERSON<|>A role the speaker had growing up, which they can no longer pursue due to their condition)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPRING SERIES<|>FALL SERIES<|>Both are biannual events where the speaker and their high school friends get together<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>X-MEN<|>PROFESSOR XAVIER<|>Professor Xavier is a character from the X-Men series<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOSPITAL<|>FENTANYL<|>The hospital administered fentanyl to the speaker<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOM<|>NURSE<|>The nurse called the speaker's mom before the surgery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLLEGE<|>CAMP<|>The speaker and one of their friends attended college and were at camp before the accident<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEST FRIENDS<|>LIFEGUARDS<|>The speaker's best friends who pulled them out of the water were lifeguards<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUADRIPLEGIC<|>HUSBAND<|>The speaker feels being a quadriplegic makes it difficult to be a husband<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUADRIPLEGIC<|>FATHER<|>The speaker feels being a quadriplegic makes it difficult to be a father<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUADRIPLEGIC<|>ATHLETE<|>The speaker was an athlete growing up but can no longer pursue this due to their condition<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
