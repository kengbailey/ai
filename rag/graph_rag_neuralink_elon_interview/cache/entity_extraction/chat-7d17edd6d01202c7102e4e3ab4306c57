You can't see them attempt to instruct the user to do something and validate that they're doing it correctly, such that then you can downstream build with confidence the mapping between the neural spikes and the intended action. And by doing the action correctly, what I really mean is at the level of resolution of what neurons are doing. So if in ideal world, you could get a signal of behavioral intent that is ground truth accurate at the scale of sort of one millisecond resolution, then with high confidence I could build a mapping from my neural spikes to that behavioral intention. But the challenge is again that you don't observe what they're actually doing. And so there's a lot of nuance to how you build user experiences that give you more than just sort of a course on average correct representation of what the users intending to do. If you want to build the world's best mouse, you really want it to be as responsive as possible. You want it to be able to do exactly what the users intending at every sort of step along the way, not just on average be correct when you're trying  we spend a lot of time working. So the calibration process, the interface has to encourage precision, being like whatever it does, it should be super intuitive, that the next thing the human is going to likely do is exactly that intention that you need, and only that intention. And you don't have any feedback except that may be speaking to you afterwards what they actually did. You can't, oh yeah. Right. So that's a, that's fundamentally, that is a really exciting UX channel, because that's all on the UX. It's not just about being friendly or nice or usable. Yeah, it's like... User experience is how it works. It's how it works. For the calibration, and calibration, at least at this stage of Neuralink, it's like fundamental to the operation of the thing. And not just calibration, but continued calibration essentially. Yeah. Wow, yeah. You said something that I think is worth exploring there a little bit. You said it's, a UX challenge. And I think a large component of it is, but there is also a very interesting machine learning challenge here, which is given some, you know, data set, including some on average correct behavior of asking the user to move way to infer in some kind of semi-supervised or entirely unsupervised way what that high-resolution version of their intention is? And if you think about it, like there probably is because there are enough data points in the data set, enough constraints on your model that there should be a way, someasurge, that there should be a way with the is exactly how hard they're pushing upwards. And at this millisecond, this is how hard they're trying to push upwards. It's really important to have very clean labels, yes? So like, the problem is it goes much harder from the machine learning perspective the labels are noisy. That's correct. Correct. Although clean labels, I think maybe it's worth exploring what that exactly means. I think any given labeling strategy will have some number of assumptions it makes about what the user is attempting to do. Those assumptions can be formulated in a loss function, or they can be formulated in terms of heuristics that you might use to just try to estimate or guess what the user is trying to do. And what really matters is how accuratethose assumptions. For example, you might say, hey, user, push upwards and follow the speed of this cursor. And your heuristic might be that they're trying to do exactly what that cursor is trying to do. Another competing heuristic might be, they're actually trying to go slightly faster at the beginning of the movement and slightly slower at the task might be, hey user, imagine moving this cursor a fixed offset. So rather than follow the cursor, just try to move it exactly 200 pixels to the right. So here's the cursor, here's the target. Okay, cursor disappears, try to move that now invisible cursor, 200 pixels to the right. And the assumption in that case would be that the user can actually modulate correctly that position offset assumption might be a weaker assumption and therefore potentially you can make it more accurate than these heuristics that are trying to guesstimate at each millisecond what the user's trying to do. So you can imagine different tasks that make different assumptions about the nature of the user intention and those assumptions being correct is what I would thinkthem by a certain offset. So that's one way. Is that the best way to do calibration? So for example, an alternative crazy way that probably is playing a role here is a game where you're just getting a very large amount of data, the person playing a game, where if they are in the state of flow, maybe you can get clean signal as a side effect. Yep. Is that, or is it, is that not an effective way for initial calibration? Yeah, great question. There's a lot to unpack there. So, the first thing I would draw a distinction between a sort of open loop first close loop. So open loop what I mean by that is the user is sort of going from zero to one. They have no model at all and they're trying to get to the place where they have some level of control at all. In that set up you really need to have some task. Then once they have a model, you could imagine them using that model and actually adapting to it and figuring out the right way to use it themselves, and then retraining in that data to give you sort of a boost in performance. There's a lot of challenges associated with both of these techniques, and we can sort of wrap it whole into both loop task is that the user themselves doesn't get pro-receptive feedback about what they're doing.
