We think about like thought experiments and things, but that's not like that's not like a physical action of doing things, it's more like what you would do in certain situations. So imagine movement, it never really connected with me. Like I guess you could maybe describe it as like a professional athlete, like swinging a baseball bat or swinging like a golf club, like imagine what you're supposed to do. But then you go right to that and physically do it. Like you, then you get a bat in your hand and then you do what you've been imagining. And so I don't have that like connection. So telling me to imagine something versus attempting it, it just, there wasn't a lot that I could do there mentally. I just kind of had to accept what was going on and try. But the attempted moving thing, it all made sense to me. Like if I try to move, then there's a signal being sent in my brain, and as long as they can pick that up, then they should be able to map it to what I'm trying to do. And so when I first moved the cursor like that, it was, it was like, yes, this should happen. Like I'm not surprised by that. But can you clarify, is there supposed to be a difference between imagined movement and attempted movement? Yeah, just that in imagined movement, you're not attempting to move at all. So it's you're like visualizing yourself doing and then theoretically, is that supposed to be a different part of the brain that lights up in those two different situations? Yeah, not necessarily. I think all these signals can still be represented in motor cortex, but the difference I think has to do with the naturalness of imagining something worse. Got it. I'm attempting and sort of fatigue of that over time. And by the way, on the mic is bliss. So like this is just different ways to prompt you to kind of get to the thing that you're around that. Yeah. Attempted movement does sound like the right thing. Yeah. Try. Yeah. I mean it makes sense to me. Because imagine for me I would start visualizing, like in my mind visualizing attempted I would actually start trying to like yeah There's a I mean I you know I did like combat sports my whole life at wrestling when I'm imagining a move See I'm like moving my muscle exactly like there's a there is a bit of an activation almost Versus like visualizing yourself like a picture doing it. Yeah, it's something that I feel like naturally? thatu. If you try to tell someone to imagine doing it. Yeah, it's something that I feel like naturally anyone would do. If you try to tell someone to imagine doing something, they might close their eyes and then start physically doing it. But it's just, you think like, yeah, it's hard. It was very hard at the beginning. But attempted worked. Attempted worked, it worked just like it should work like, work like a charm. Remember there was like one Tuesday we were messing around and I think I forget what swear word you used, but there's a swear word that came out of your mouth when you figured out you could just do the direct cursor control. Yeah, that's it, it blew my mind, like no pun intended, blew my mind when I first moved the cursor just with my thoughts and not attempting to move. It's something that I found like over the couple of weeks like building up to that, that as I get better cursor controls, like the model gets better, then it gets easier for me to, like, I don't have to attempt as much to move it. And part of that is something that I'd even talked with them about when I was watching the signals of my brain one day, I was watching when I attempted to move to the right and I watched the screen as like I saw the spikes. I was seeing the spike, the signal was being sent before I was actually attempting to move. I imagine just because, you know, when you go to, say, move your hand or any body part, that signal gets sent before you're actually moving, has to say move your hand or any body part that signal gets sent before you're actually moving has to make it all the way down and back up before you actually do any sort of movement. So there's a delay there and I noticed that there was something going on in my brain before I was actually attempting to move that my brain was like anticipating what I wanted to do. And that all started sort of, I don't know, like percolating in my brain. Like it just, it was just sort of there, like always in the back, like that's so weird that it could do that. It kind of makes sense, but I wonder what that means as far as like using the neuralink and You know and then as I was playing around with the attempted movement and playing around with the cursor and I saw that like as the cursor control got better that it was Anticipating my movements and what I wanted it to do like cursor, what I wanted to do a bit better and a bit better. And then one day I just randomly, as I was playing webgrid, I looked at a target before I had started like attempting to move. I was just trying to like get over like train my eyes to start looking ahead like okay this is the target I'm on but if I look over here to this target I know I can like maybe be a bit quicker getting there and I looked over and the cursor just shot over it's oh it was wild like I had to take a step day I was just smiling. I was so giddy. I was like, guys, do you know that this works?\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BLISS<|>PERSON<|>Bliss is the person speaking on the microphone during the conversation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a company developing brain-machine interfaces, which is being discussed in the context of controlling a cursor with thoughts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBGRID<|>EVENT<|>Webgrid is a game or application being used to test cursor control through brain signals)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLISS<|>NEURALINK<|>Bliss is discussing the use of Neuralink technology to control a cursor with thoughts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>WEBGRID<|>Neuralink technology is being used to control the cursor in the Webgrid application<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
