Not all of them are equally controllable by the end user. And so the, you know, it might be as simple as saying, oh, you can just add auxiliary loss terms that like help you capture the thing that actually matters, but this is a very complex nuance process. is more of a nuanced process than just like a standard supervised learning problem. One very fascinating anecdote here, we've tried many different sort of neural network architectures that translate brain data to velocity outputs, for example. And one example that's stuck in my brain from a couple years ago now is we at one point we were using just fully connected networks to decode the brain activity. We tried a B test where we were measuring the relative performance in online control sessions of sort of one decomposition over the input signal. So if you imagine per channel, you have a sliding window that's producing some convolved feature for each of those input sequences for every single channel simultaneously. You can actually get better validation metrics, meaning you're fitting the data better and it's generalizing better in offline data, if you use this convolutional architecture. You're reducing parameters, it's sort of a standard standard procedure when you're dealing with time-series data. Now it turns out that when using that model online, the controllability was worse, was far worse, even though the offline metrics were better. And there can be many ways to interpret that, but what that taught me at least was that, hey, it's at least the case right now that if you were to just throw a bunch of compute at this problem and you were trying to sort of high parameter optimize or let some GPT model, or you know, let some GPT or that there's still some inherent modeling gap here. There's still some artistry left to be uncovered here of how to get your model to scale with more compute and that may be fundamentally labeling problem, but there may be other components to this as well. Is it data constraint at this time, like the, which is what it sounds like, like how do you get a lot of good labels? Yeah, I think it's data quality constrained, not necessarily data, quantity constrained. But even like, even just a quantity, I mean, because it has to be trained on the interactions, I guess there's not that many interactions. Yeah, so it depends what version of this you're talking about. So if you're talking about, let's say the simplest example of just 2D velocity, then I think, yeah, data quality is the main thing. If you're talking about how to build a sort of multifunction output that lets you do all the inputs to the computer that you and I can do, then it's actually a much more sophisticated nuance, because now you need to think about not just when the user istrying to right click or when they're trying to move the mouse. So one example of an interesting bug from like sort of week one of BCI with Nolan was when he moved the mouse, the click signal sort of dropped off a cliff and when he stopped the click signal went up. So again, there's a contamination between the two inputs. Another good example was at one point he was trying to do sort of a left click in Drad and the minute he started moving, the left click signal dropped off a cliff. So again, because there's some contamination between the two signals, you need to come up with some way to either in the data set or in the model, build robustness against this kind of, you can think of it like overfitting, but really it's just that the model has not seen this kind of variability before. So you need to find some way to help the model with that. This is super cool. Because it feels like all of this is very solvable, but it's hard. Yes, it is fundamentally an engineering challenge. This is important to emphasize, and it's also important to emphasize that it may not need fundamentally new techniques, which means that people who work on, let's say, on supervised speech classification, using CTCLAWS, to Siri, they could potentially have very applicable skills to this. So what things are you excited about in the future development of the software stack on the NeuralLink? So everything we've been talking about, the decoding, the U.S. I think there's some I'm excited about, like something I'm excited about from the technology side, and some I'll work backwards. On the technology entering the world side of things, I'm really excited to understand how this device works for folks that cannot speak at all, that have no ability to sort of bootstruck themselves into useful control by voice command, for example, and are extremely limited in their current capabilities. I think that will be an incredibly useful signal for us to to  mean, really what is an existential type for all startups, which is product market fit. Does this device have the capacity and potential to transform people's lives in the current state? And if not, what are the gaps? And if there are gaps, how do we're doing? thiiiii. thrown, I thin' thi're doing. I think it's going to be awesome. The most prominent one I would say is scaling channel count. So right now we have a thousand channel device. The next version will have between 3 and 6,000 channels, and I would expect that curve, the curfews to continue in the future. And it's unclear what set of problems will just disappear completely at the scale. And what set of problems will remain and require further focus? And so I'm excited about the clarity of gradient that that gives us in terms of the user experiences that we choose to focus our time and resources on. And also in terms of the, yeah, even things as simple as non-stationarity\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
