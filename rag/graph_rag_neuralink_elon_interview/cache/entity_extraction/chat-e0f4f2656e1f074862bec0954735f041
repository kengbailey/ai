You know, you think about all the really great triumphs in human history, you think about all the really horrific tragedies, you know, you think about the Holocaust, you think about any prison full of human stories, and all of those problems boil down to neurochemistry. So if you get a little bit of control over that, you provide people the option to do better, in the way I read history, the way people have dealt with having better tools is that they most often in the end do better with huge asterisks. But I think it's an interesting, worthy, and noble pursuit to give people more options, more tools. Yeah, that's a fascinating way to look at human history. You just imagine all these neurobiological mechanisms, Stalin, Hitler, all of these Jengus Kahn, all of them just had like a brain. It's just a bunch of neurons, you know, like a few tons of billions of neurons gaining a bunch of information over a period of time. They have a set of module that does language and memory and all that. And from there, in the case of those people, they're able to murder millions of people. Yeah. And all there, in the case of those people, they're able to murder millions of people. And all that coming from, there's not some glorified notion of a dictator of this enormous mind or something like this. It's just, it's just the brain. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, a lot of that has to do with how well people like that can organize those around them. Other brains. Yeah. And so I always find it interesting to look to primatology, you know, look to our closest non-human relatives for clues as to how humans are going to behave and what particular humans are able to achieve. And so you look at chimpanzees and bonobos, and they're similar, but different in their social structures, particularly. And I went to Emory in Atlanta and studied under Friends to All, the great friends to all, who was kind of the leading primatologist, who recently died. And his work in looking at chimps through the lens of, you know, how you would watch an episode of friends and understand the motivations of the characters interacting with each other, he would look at a chimp colony and basically apply that lens. I'm massively oversimplifying it. If you do that, instead of just saying you know, subject 473, you know, through his feces, it's subject 471, you talk about them in terms of their human struggles, accord them the dignity of themselves as actors with understandable goals and drives what they want out of life. And primarily it's, you know, the things we want out of life, food, sex, companionship, power. You can understand chimp and bonobo behavior in the same lights much more easily. And I think doing so gives you the tools you need to reduce human behavior from the kind of false complexity that we layer on to it with language and look at it in terms of all these humans are looking for companionship, sex, food, power. And I think that that's a pretty powerful tool to have in understanding human behavior. And I just went to the Amazon jungle for a few weeks. And it's a very visceral reminder that a lot of life on earth is just trying to get laid. They're all screaming at each other. Like I saw a lot of monkeys, and they're just trying to get laid. They're all screaming at each other. Like I saw a lot of monkeys and they're just trying to impress each other or maybe if there's a battle for power, but a lot of the battle for power has to do with them getting laid. Right. Breeding rights often go with alpha status. And so if you can get a piece of that, then you're like to think that we're somehow fundamentally different, but especially when it comes to primates where we really aren't, you know, we can use fancier poetic language, but maybe some of the underlying drives that motivate us are similar. Yeah, I think that's true. And all that is coming from this, the brain. Yeah. When did you first start studying the brain as a biological mechanism? Basically the moment I got to college I started looking around for labs that I could do neuroscience work in. I originally approached that from the angle of looking at interactions between the brain and the immune system which isn't the most obvious place to start but I had this idea at the time that the contents of your brain the brain and the immune system, which isn't the most obvious place to start. But I had this idea at the time that the contents of your thoughts would have an impact, a direct impact, maybe a powerful one, on non-conscious systems in your body. The systems we think of as, you know, homeostatic automatic mechanisms like fighting off a virus, like repairing a wound. And sure enough there are big crossovers between the two. I mean, it gets to kind of a key point that I think goes under-recognized. One of the things people don't recognize or appreciate about the human brain enough, and that is that it basically controls or has a huge role in almost everything that your body does. Like you try to name an example of something in your body that isn't directly controlled or massively influenced by the brain. And it's pretty hard. I mean, you might say like bone healing or something, but even those systems, the hypothalamus and pituitary end up playing a role in coordinating the endocrine system that does have a direct influence on, say, the calcium level in your blood that goes to bone healing\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
