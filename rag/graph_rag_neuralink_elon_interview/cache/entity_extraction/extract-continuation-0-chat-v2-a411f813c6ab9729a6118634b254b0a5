And that's required before you can then market the device. And,that's how it works in the US and just generally around the world. That's the process you follow. So, you know, our goal is to really just understand from people like Nolan, P2, P3, future participants, what aspects of our device needs to improve. If it turns out that people are like, I really don't like the fact that it lasts only six hours. I want to be able to use this computer for, you know, like 24 hours. I mean, that's, that is a, you know, user needs and user requirements, which we can only find out from just, just being able to engage with them. So before the pivotal study, there's kind of like a rapid innovation based on individual experiences experiences. You're learning from individual people how they use it, like the high resolution details in terms of like cursor control and signal and all that kind of stuff to like life experience. Yeah, so there's hardware changes but also just just firmware updates. So even when we, you know, had that sort of recovery event for Nolan, you know, he now has the new firmware that he has been updated with. And similar to how like your phones get updated all the time with new formors for security patches, whatever new functionality, UI, and that's something that is possible with our implant. It's not a static one-time device that, that can only do the thing that it said it can do. I mean, similar to Tesla, you can do over-the-air firmware updates, and now you have completely new user interface and all this bells and whistles and improvements on everything, like the latest, right? That's, that's, you know, when we say generalized platform, that's what we're talking about. Yeah, it's really cool. how the the app that Nolan is using, there's like calibration, all that all that kind of stuff, and then there's update. You just click and get an update. What other future capabilities are you kind of looking to? You said vision, that's a fascinating one. What about sort of accelerated typing or speech, this kind of stuff? Yeah, and what else is there? Yeah, those are still in the realm of movement program. So largely speaking, we have two programs. We have the movement program and we have the vision program. The movement program currently is focused around, you know, the digital freedom. As you can easily guess, if you can control, you know, to the cursor in the digital space, you could move anything in the physical space. So robotic arms, wheelchair, your environment, or even really, like, whether it's through the phone or just like directly to those interfaces, so like to those machines. So we're looking at ways to kind of expand those types of capability even for Nolan. That requires, you know, conversation with the FDA and kind of showing safety data for, you know, if there's a robotic arm or wheelchair that we can guarantee that they're not going to hurt themselves accidentally. It's very different. If you're moving stuff in the digital domain versus like in the physical space, you can actually potentially cause harm to the participants. So we're working through that right now. Speech does involve different areas of the brain. Speech prosthetic is very, very fascinating and there's actually been a lot of really amazing work that's been happening in academia. You know, Sergei Staviski at UC Davis, Jamie Henderson, and, you know, late Krishna Shinoi at Stanford doing just some incredible amount of work in improving speech neuroprosthetics. And those are actually looking more at parts of the motor cortex that are controlling, you know, these vocal articulators. And, you know, being vocal articulators and you know being able to like even by mouthing the word or imagine speech you can pick up those signals. The more sophisticated higher level processing areas like you know the Brokha's area or you know Warnike's area those are still very very big mystery in terms of the underlying mechanism of how all that stuff works. But yeah, I mean, I think Neurally's eventual goal is to kind of understand those things and be able to provide a platform and tools to be able to understand that and study that. This is where I get to the pothead questions. Do you think we can start getting insight into things like thought? So speech is, there's a muscular component, like you said. There's like the act of producing sounds. But then what about the internal things, like cognition? Like low-level thoughts and high-level thoughts. Do you think we'll start noticing kind of signals that could be picked up, that could, they could be understood, that could be maybe used in order to interact with the outside world? In some ways, like I guess this starts to kind of get into the hard problem of consciousness. And I mean, on one hand, all of these are at some point set of electrical signals that from there, maybe it in itself is giving you the cognition or the meaning, or somehow human mind is an incredibly amazing storytelling machine. So we're telling ourselves and fooling ourselves that there's some interesting meaning here. But I mean, I certainly think that BCI, and really, PCI at the end of the day, is a set of tools that help you kind of study the underlying mechanisms in a both like local but also broader sense. And whether, you know, there's some interesting patterns of like electrical signal that means like\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>Nolan is a participant in the early feasibility study who has received firmware updates for the device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P2<|>PERSON<|>P2 is a future participant in the early feasibility study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P3<|>PERSON<|>P3 is a future participant in the early feasibility study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a company known for its over-the-air firmware updates, similar to the updates provided for the implant device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The FDA is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which requires safety data for devices like robotic arms and wheelchairs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERGEI STAVISKI<|>PERSON<|>Sergei Staviski is a researcher at UC Davis working on speech neuroprosthetics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UC DAVIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UC Davis is a university where Sergei Staviski conducts research on speech neuroprosthetics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMIE HENDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Jamie Henderson is a researcher working on speech neuroprosthetics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHNA SHINOI<|>PERSON<|>Krishna Shinoi was a researcher at Stanford who worked on improving speech neuroprosthetics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANFORD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stanford is a university where Krishna Shinoi conducted research on speech neuroprosthetics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROKHA'S AREA<|>GEO<|>Broca's area is a region in the brain involved in speech production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARNIKE'S AREA<|>GEO<|>Wernicke's area is a region in the brain involved in language comprehension)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURALLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neurally is a company aiming to understand brain mechanisms and provide tools for studying them)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>NEURALLY<|>Nolan is a participant in Neurally's early feasibility study and has received firmware updates<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>NEURALLY<|>Neurally's implant device updates are compared to Tesla's over-the-air firmware updates<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FDA<|>NEURALLY<|>Neurally needs to provide safety data to the FDA for devices like robotic arms and wheelchairs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERGEI STAVISKI<|>UC DAVIS<|>Sergei Staviski conducts research on speech neuroprosthetics at UC Davis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMIE HENDERSON<|>NEURALLY<|>Jamie Henderson is mentioned as a researcher contributing to the field of speech neuroprosthetics, which Neurally is interested in<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHNA SHINOI<|>STANFORD<|>Krishna Shinoi conducted research on speech neuroprosthetics at Stanford<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROKHA'S AREA<|>NEURALLY<|>Neurally aims to understand the mechanisms of Broca's area for speech production<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WARNIKE'S AREA<|>NEURALLY<|>Neurally aims to understand the mechanisms of Wernicke's area for language comprehension<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
