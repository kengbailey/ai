Maybe before we talk about Neural and can you give a sense of the history of the field of BCI? What has been maybe the continued dream and also some of the milestones along the way of the different approaches and the amazing work done at the various labs. I think a good starting point is going back to 1790s. I did not expect that. Where the concept of animal electricity or the fact that body is electric was first discovered by Luigi Galvani where he had this famous experiment where he connected set of electrodes to frog leg and ran current through it and then it started twitching and he said oh my goodness body's electric yeah so fast forward many, many years to 1920s, where Hansberger, who is a German psychiatrist, discovered EEG or electroencephalography, which is still around, there are these electrode arrays that you wear outside the skull that gives you some sort of neural recording. That was a very, very big milestone that you can record some sort of activities about the human mind. And then in the 1940s, there were these group of scientists, Renshaw, Forbes, and Morrison that inserted these glass microelectrodes into the cortex and recorded single neurons. The fact that there's signal that are a bit more high resolution and high fidelity as you get closer to the source, let's say. And in the 1950s, these two scientists, Hodgkin and Huxley showed up, and they built this beautiful, beautiful models of the cell membrane and the ionic mechanism and had these circuit diagram. And as someone who is an electrical engineer, it's a beautiful model that's built out of these partial differential equations, talking about flow of ions and how that really leads to how neurons communicate. And they won the Nobel Prize for that 10 years later in the 1960s. So in 1969, Ed FETS from University of Washington published this beautiful paper called operin conditioning of cortical unit activity where he was able to record a single unit neuron from a monkey and was able to have a single unit neuron from a monkey and was able to have the monkey modulated based on its activity and reward system. So I would say this is the very, very first example, as far as I'm aware of the closed loop, you know, brain computer interface or BCI. The abstract reads, the activity of single neurons in pre-central cortex of anesthesized monkeys was conditioned by reinforcing high rates of neuronal discharge with delivery of a food pot. Auditorial and visual feedback of unit firing rates was usually provided an addition to food reinforcement. Cool. So, they actually got it done. They got it done. This is back in 1969. After several training sessions, monkeys could increase the activity of newly isolated cells by 50 to 500% above rates before reinforcement. Fascinating. Brain is very plastic. And so, and so from here here the number of experiments grew. Yeah, number of experiments as well as set of tools to interface with the brain have just exploded. I think, and also just understanding the neural code and how some of the cortical layers and the functions are organized. So the other paper that is pretty seminal, especially in the motor decoding, was this paper in the 1980s from Georgiopolis, that discovered that there's this thing called motor tuning curve. So what are motor tuning curves? It's the fact that there are neurons in the motor cortex of mammals, including humans, that have a preferential direction that causes them to fire. So what that means is there are set of neurons that would increase their, right, up, down, and any of those vectors. And based on that, you know, you can start to think, well, if you can identify those essential eigenvectors, you can do a lot. And you can actually use that information for actually decoding someone's intended movement from the cortex. So that was a very, very seminal kind of paper that showed that there is some sort of code that you can extract, especially in the mortal cortex. So there's signal there. And if you measure the electrical signal from the the electrical signal from the brain, that you could actually figure out what the intention was. Correct. Yeah, not only electrical signals, but electrical signals from the right set of neurons that give you these preferential direction. Okay, so going slowly towards Neural Link, one interesting question is what do I understand on the BCI front on invasive versus non-invasive from this line of work? How important is it to park next to the neuron? What does that get you? That answer fundamentally depends on what you want to do with it, right? There's actually incredible amount of stuff that you can do with EEG and electrocordograph, e-cog, which actually doesn't penetrate the cortical layer or parancoma, but you place a set of electrodes on the surface of the brain. So the thing that I'm personally very interested in is just actually understanding and being able to just really tap into the high resolution, high fidelity, understanding of the activities that are happening at the local level. And, you know, we can get into biophysics, but just to kind of step back to kind of use analogy because the analogy here can be useful. And sometimes it's a little bit difficult to think about electricity. At the end of they were doing electrical recording that's mediated by ionic currents, you know, movements of these charged particles, which is really, really hard for most people to think about. But turns out a lot of the activities that are happening in the brain, and the frequency band with which that's happening is actually very, very similar to sound waves and our normal conversation, audible range, range. So the analogy that typically is used in the field is in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUIGI GALVANI<|>PERSON<|>Luigi Galvani was a scientist who discovered the concept of animal electricity in the 1790s through his famous experiment with frog legs and electrodes<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANSBERGER<|>PERSON<|>Hansberger was a German psychiatrist who discovered EEG (electroencephalography) in the 1920s, which allows for neural recording through electrode arrays placed outside the skull<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENSHAW<|>PERSON<|>Renshaw was one of the scientists in the 1940s who inserted glass microelectrodes into the cortex to record single neurons<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORBES<|>PERSON<|>Forbes was one of the scientists in the 1940s who inserted glass microelectrodes into the cortex to record single neurons<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORRISON<|>PERSON<|>Morrison was one of the scientists in the 1940s who inserted glass microelectrodes into the cortex to record single neurons<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HODGKIN<|>PERSON<|>Hodgkin was a scientist in the 1950s who, along with Huxley, built models of the cell membrane and ionic mechanisms, leading to a better understanding of how neurons communicate<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUXLEY<|>PERSON<|>Huxley was a scientist in the 1950s who, along with Hodgkin, built models of the cell membrane and ionic mechanisms, leading to a better understanding of how neurons communicate<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ED FETS<|>PERSON<|>Ed Fets was a scientist from the University of Washington who published a paper in 1969 on operant conditioning of cortical unit activity, marking the first example of a closed-loop brain-computer interface<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Washington is an educational institution where Ed Fets conducted his research on brain-computer interfaces<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGIAPOLIS<|>PERSON<|>Georgiopolis was a scientist in the 1980s who discovered motor tuning curves, which are neurons in the motor cortex that have a preferential direction causing them to fire<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neuralink is a company focused on developing brain-computer interfaces<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUIGI GALVANI<|>HANSBERGER<|>Luigi Galvani's discovery of animal electricity in the 1790s laid the groundwork for Hansberger's discovery of EEG in the 1920s<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HANSBERGER<|>RENSHAW<|>Hansberger's discovery of EEG in the 1920s was a precursor to the work of Renshaw and his colleagues in the 1940s on recording single neurons<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENSHAW<|>FORBES<|>Renshaw and Forbes were part of the same group of scientists in the 1940s who inserted glass microelectrodes into the cortex to record single neurons<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENSHAW<|>MORRISON<|>Renshaw and Morrison were part of the same group of scientists in the 1940s who inserted glass microelectrodes into the cortex to record single neurons<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORBES<|>MORRISON<|>Forbes and Morrison were part of the same group of scientists in the 1940s who inserted glass microelectrodes into the cortex to record single neurons<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HODGKIN<|>HUXLEY<|>Hodgkin and Huxley collaborated in the 1950s to build models of the cell membrane and ionic mechanisms, leading to a better understanding of how neurons communicate<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ED FETS<|>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON<|>Ed Fets conducted his research on brain-computer interfaces at the University of Washington<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGIAPOLIS<|>ED FETS<|>Georgiopolis's discovery of motor tuning curves in the 1980s built upon the foundational work of Ed Fets in the 1960s on brain-computer interfaces<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURALINK<|>ED FETS<|>Neuralink's work on brain-computer interfaces is a continuation of the foundational research conducted by Ed Fets<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
