Went back and found that some community of people loved it and had propped up the value of it and so it had gone up 50-fold. So there was a lot of change in those cushions. That's hilarious. But the primary use case is mostly as a as a tech demonstrator, you know, it has my business card on it. You can scan that in by touching it to your phone. It opens the front door to my house, you know, whatever, simple stuff. It's a cool leap to implant something in your body. I mean it has perhaps that's, it's a similar leap to in your link. Because for a lot of people, that kind of notion of putting something inside your body, something electronic inside a biological system is a big leap. Yeah, we have a kind of a mysticism around the barrier of our skin. We're completely fine with knee replacements, hip replacements, you know, dental implants. But, you know, there's a mysticism still around the inviolable barrier that the skull represents. And I think that needs to be treated like any other pragmatic barrier. You know, it's, the question isn't, how incredible is it to open the skull? The question is, you know, what benefit can we provide? So from all the surgeries you've done, from everything you understand the brain, how much does neuroplasticity come into play? How adaptable is the brain? For example, just even in the case of healing from surgery, or adapting to the post-surgery situation? The answer that is sad for me and other people, of my demographic is that, you know, plasticity decreases with age healing decreases with age I have too much gray hair to To be optimistic about that. There are theoretical ways to increase plasticity using electrical stimulation Nothing that is you know totally proven out as a robust enough mechanism to offer widely to people. But yeah, I think there's cause for optimism that we might find something useful in terms of, say, an implanted electrode that improves learning. Certainly, there's been some really amazing work recently from Nicholas Schiff, Jonathan Baker, you know, and others who have a cohort of patients with moderate traumatic brain injury who have had electrodes placed in the deep nucleus in the brain called the centrimean nucleus or just near the centrimead nucleus and when they apply small amounts of electricity to that part of the brain, it's almost like electronic caffeine. They're able to improve people's attention and focus. They're able to improve how well people can perform a task. I think in one case, someone who was unable to work after the device was turned on, they were able to get a job. And that's sort of, you know, one of the holy grails, for me with Neurolink and other technologies like this, is from a purely utilitarian standpoint, can we make people able to take care of themselves and their families economically again? Can we make it so someone who's fully dependent, and even maybe requires a lot of caregiver resources? Can we put them in a position to be fully independent, taking care of themselves, giving back to their communities? I think I think that's a very compelling proposition and what motivates a lot of what I do and what a lot of the people at Neurlink are working for. It's just a cool possibility what I do and what a lot of the people at Neuralink are working for. It's just a cool possibility that if you put a Neuralink in there, that the brain adapts, like the other part of the brain adapts to. Yeah, and it integrates it. The capacity of the brain to do that, it's really interesting. Probably unknown to the degree to what you can do that, but you're now connecting an external thing to it, especially once it's doing stimulation. Like, the biological brain and the electronic brain outside of it working together, the possibilities they're really interesting. It's still unknown, but interesting. It feels like the brain is really good at adapting to whatever. Yeah. But of course it is a system that by itself is already, like everything serves the purpose. And so you don't want to mess with it too much. Yeah, it's like, you know, eliminating a species from an ecology. You know, you don't know what the delicate interconnections and dependencies are. The brain is certainly a delicate complex beast and we don't know every potential downstream consequence of a single change that we make. Do you see yourself doing, so you mentioned P1, surgeries of P2, P3, P4, P5, just more and more humans? I think, you know, it's a certain kind of brittleness or, you know, a failure on the company's side if we need me to do all the surgeries, I think something that I would very much like to work towards is a process that is so simple and so robust on the surgery side that literally anyone could do it. We want to get away from requiring intense expertise or intense experience to have this successfully done and make it as simple and translatable as possible. I mean, I would love it if every neurosurgeon on the planet had no problem doing this. I think we're probably far from a regulatory environment that would allow people that aren't neurosurgeons to do this, but not impossible. All right, I'll sign up for that. Did you ever anthropomorphize the robot, R1? Like do you give it a name? Do you see it as like a friend that's like working together with you? I mean to a certain degree it's... Or anatomy who's going to take the job? To a certain degree it's... yeah, it's\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
