One reason that approach is super convenient is that you can actually implement that extremely efficiently in hardware, which means that you can run it in a low power across a thousand two-a. Another approach that we've recently started exploring, and this can be combined with the spike detection approach, something called spike bandpower. And the benefits of that approach are that you may be able to pick up some signal from neurons that are maybe too far away to be detected as a spike, because the farther away you are from an electrode, the weaker that actual spike waveform will look like on that electrode. So, you might be able to pick up, you know, population level activity of things that are, you know, maybe slightly outside the normal recording radius, what neuroscientists sometimes refer to as the hash of activity, the other stuff that's going on. And you can look at sort of across many channels how that sort of background noise is behaving, you might be able to get more juice out of the signal that way. But it comes at a cost. That signal is now a floating point representation which means it's more expensive to send out over power. It means you have to find different ways to compress it that are different than what you can apply to binary signals. So there's a lot of different challenges associated with these different modalities. So also in terms of communication you're limited by the amount of data you can send. Yeah. So and also because you're currently using the Bluetooth protocol, you have to batch stuff together. But you have to also do this keeping the latency crazy low, like crazy low. Anything to say about the latency? Yeah, this is a passion project of mine. So I want to build the best mouse in the world. I don't want to build like the Chevrolet Spark or whatever of electric cars. I want to build like the Tesla Roadster version of a mouse. And I really do think it's quite possible that within, you know, five to ten years that most e-sports competitions are dominated by people with paralysis. This is like a very real possibility for number of reasons. One is that they'll have access to the best technology to play video games effectively, the second is they have the time to do so. So those two factors together are particularly potent for e-sport competitors. Unless people without paralysis are also allowed to implant you. Right. Which is, it is another way to interact with a digital device. And there's something to that if it's a fundamentally different experience, more efficient experience, even if it's not like some kind of full-on high bandwidth communication, if it's just the ability to move the mouse, 10x faster, like the bits per second, if I can achieve a bit per second that 10x what I can do with the mouse, that's a really interesting possibility what they can do, especially as you get really good at it with training. It's definitely the case that you have a higher ceiling performance. Like you, because you don't have to buffer your intention through your arm, through your muscle, you get just by nature of having a brain implant at all, like 75 millisecond, the tien trying to take. And there's some nuance of this, like there's evidence that the motor cortex, you can sort of plan out sequences of action, so you may not get that whole benefit all the time. But for sort of like reaction time style games where you just want to, someone is over here, snip them, you know, faster than, you know, what you would do if you're going through muscle from a latency point of view, and we're in the early stage of that. I think we can push it, sort of our end-to-end latency right now from brain spike to cursor movement, it's about 22 milliseconds. If it's about 22 milliseconds, the teasures. If you think about the best mice in the te. that's that's that's that's that's. thiice. thi mice. thi mice. thi mice. thi. thi. thi. thi. thi. thi. thininin. thin. thin. thin. thin. thin. thin-a' thin-in-in thin-s. thin thin thin-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in, th. thin, thin, thin, thin, thin, thin, thin, thin, I I I I I I I I I's thinnn refreshes. There's a lot of characteristics that matter there, but yeah, and the rough time for like a neuron in the brain to actually impact your command of your hand is about 75 milliseconds. So if you look at those numbers, you can see that we're already like, you know, competitive and slightly faster than what you'd get by actually moving your, moving your hand. And this is something the first time, we asked him about this. It was something I was super curious about. What does it feel like when you're modulating, you know, a click intention or when you're trying to just move the cursor to the right? He said it moves before he is like actually intending it to move. Yeah, I suppose we've gotten used to that latency, that natural latency that happens. So is the currently the bottleneck the communication, so like the Bluetooth communication, is that what's the actual bottleneck? I mean there's always going to be a bottleneck, what's the current bolenake? Yeah, a couple things. So kind of hilariously, Bluetooth low-energy protocol has some restrictions on how fast you can communicate. So the protocol itself establishes a standard of, you know, the most frequent sort of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA ROADSTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tesla Roadster is a high-performance electric car model produced by Tesla, Inc.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEVROLET SPARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chevrolet Spark is a compact car model produced by Chevrolet, a division of General Motors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUETOOTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTOR CORTEX<|>PERSON<|>The motor cortex is a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E-SPORTS<|>EVENT<|>E-sports are competitive video gaming events where players and teams compete in various video games for prizes and recognition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARALYSIS<|>PERSON<|>Paralysis is the loss of the ability to move in part or most of the body, typically as a result of illness, poison, or injury)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA ROADSTER<|>CHEVROLET SPARK<|>The Tesla Roadster and Chevrolet Spark are compared to illustrate the difference between high-performance and basic models<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLUETOOTH<|>E-SPORTS<|>Bluetooth technology is used in communication devices that can be utilized in e-sports<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTOR CORTEX<|>PARALYSIS<|>The motor cortex is involved in voluntary movements, which can be affected by paralysis<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
