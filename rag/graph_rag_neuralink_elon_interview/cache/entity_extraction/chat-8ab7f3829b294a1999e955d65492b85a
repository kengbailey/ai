So we woke up pretty early. I'm not sure much of us slept that night. Um, got to the hospital 5.30, went through like all the pre-op stuff. Everyone was super nice. Elon was supposed to be there in the morning, but something went wrong with his plane. So we ended up face timing. That was cool. Had one of the greatest one-liners of my life after that phone call, hung up with him. There were like 20 people around me, and I was like, I just hope he wasn't too starstruck talking to me. Nice. Yeah, it was good. Well done. Yeah. Did you write that ahead of time? No. It just came to me. I was like, this is, this seems right, you know? Went into surgery, I asked if I could pray right beforehand, so I like prayed over the room. I asked God if you would like be with my mom in case anything happened to me and just like calm her nerves out there, woke up and played a bit of a prank on my mom. I don't know if you've heard about it. Yeah, I read about it. Yeah, she was not happy. Can you take me through the prank? Yeah, this is something... You regret doing that now? No, no, not one bit. It was something I had talked about ahead of time with my buddy Bain. I was like, I would really like to play a prank on my mom. Very specifically my mom, she's very gullible. I think she had knee surgery once even, and after she came out of knee surgery, she was super groggy. She's like, I can't feel my legs. And my dad looked at her, he was like, you don't have any legs. Like, they had, they had to amputate both your legs. And we just do very mean things to her all the time. I'm so surprised that she still loves us. But right after surgery, I was really worried that I was going to be too groggy, like not all there. I've had anesthesia once before and it messed me up. Like I could not function for a while afterwards and I said a lot of things that I was like, I was really worried that I was going to start, I don't know, like dropping some bombs and I wouldn't even know I wouldn't remember. So I was like, please God don't let that happen and please let me be there enough to do this to my mom. And so she walked in after surgery it was like the first time they had been able to see me after surgery and she just looked at me and she said, hi like how are you, how are you doing? How do you feel? And I looked at her and this very, I think the anesthesia help, very like groggy, sort of confused look on my face. It's like, who are you? And she just started looking around the room like at the surgeons, like what did you do to my son? like you need to fix this right now Tears started streaming I saw how much she was freaking out. I was like I can't let this go on and So I was like mom mom I don't know what that's going to look like. It's a lifelong battle. Yeah. But it was good. In some sense, it was a demonstration that you still got. That's all I wanted to be. That's all I wanted it to be. And I knew that doing something super mean to her like that would show her. Yeah. To show that you're still there, that you love her. Yeah, exactly. It's a dark way to do it, but I love it. Yeah. What was the first time you were able to feel that you can use the NeuralLink device to affect the world around you? Yeah, the first little taste I got of it was actually not too long after surgery. Some of the neurolink team had brought in like a little iPad, a little tablet screen, and they'd put up eight different channels that were recording some of my neuron spikes, and they put it in front of me, like this is like real-time your brain firing. It's like that's super cool. My first thought was, I mean, if they're firing now, let's see if I can affect them in some way. So I started trying to like wiggle my fingers. And I just started like scanning through the channels. And one of the things I was doing was like moving my index finger up and down. And I just saw this yellow spike on like top row like third box over or something I saw this yellow spike every time I did it and I was like oh that's cool and everyone around was just like what what are you seeing I was like look at this one look at like this top row third box over this yellow spike like that's me right there there, and everyone was freaking out. They started like clapping. I was like, that's super unnecessary. This is what's supposed to happen, right? So you're imagining yourself moving each individual finger one at a time and then seeing like, you can notice something. And then when you did the index finger, you're like, oh. Yeah, I was, I was wiggling kind of all of my fingers to see if anything would happen. There was a lot of other things going on, but that big yellow spike was the one that stood out to me. Like I'm sure that if I would have stared at\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
