You know, I always wanted to be a husband and father and I just don't think that I could do it now as a quadriplegic. Maybe it's possible, but I'm not sure I would ever put, you know, someone I love through that, like having to take care of me and stuff. Not being able to go out and play sports. I was a huge athlete growing up, so that was pretty hard. Little things do when I realize I can't do them anymore. There's something really special about being able to hold a book and smell a book, like the feel, the texture, the smell, like as you turn the pages, like I just love it, I can't do it anymore. It's little things like that. The two-year mark was pretty rough. Two years is when they say you will get back, basically as much as you're ever going to get back as far as movement and sensation goes. And so for the first two years, that was the only thing on my mind was like try as much as I can to move my fingers, my hands, my feet, everything possible to try to get sensation and movement back. And then when the two-year mark hit, so June 30th, 2018, I was really sad. That's kind of where I was. And then just randomly here and there, but I was never like depressed for long periods of time. Just, it never seemed worthwhile to me. What gave you strength? My faith, my faith in God was a big one. My understanding that it was all for purpose and even if that purpose wasn't anything involving Neurlink, even if that purpose was, you know, there's a story in the Bible about Job, and I think it's a really, really popular story about how Job, you know, has all of these terrible things happen to him and he praises God throughout the whole situation. I thought, and I think a lot of people think for most of their lives, that they are Job, that they're the ones going through something terrible and they just need to, you know, praise God through the whole thing and everything will work out. At some point after my accident, I realized that I might not be Job, that I might be, you know, one of his children that gets killed or kidnapped or taken from him. And so it's about terrible things that happen to those around you who you love. So maybe, you know, in this case, my mom would be Job. And she has to get through something extraordinarily hard. And I just need to try and make it as best as possible for her because she's the one that's really going through this massive trial. And that gave me a lot of strength. And obviously my family, my family and my friends, they give me all the strength that I need on a day-to-day basis. So, makes things a lot easier having that great support system around me. From everything I've seen of you online, your streams, and the way you are today, I really admire, let's say, your unwavering positive outlook on life. Has that always been this way? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've just always thought I could do it. I could do anything I ever wanted to do. There was never anything too big. Like whatever I set my mind to, I felt like I could do it. I didn't want to do a lot. I wanted to like travel around and be sort of like a gypsy and like go work odd jobs. I had this dream of traveling around Europe and being like, I don't know, a shepherd in like Wales or Ireland and then going and being a fisherman in Italy, doing all of these things for like a year. Like it's such like cliche things, but I just thought it would be so much fun to go and travel and do different things. And so I've always just seen the best in people around me too. And I've always tried to be good to people. And growing up with my mom too, she's like the most positive, energetic person in the world. And we're all just people, people. Like, I just get along great with people. I really enjoy meeting new people. And so I just wanted to do everything. This is just kind of just how I've been. It's just great to see that cynicism didn't take over given everything you've been through. Yeah. That's uh, was that like a deliberate choice you made? That you're not going to let this keep you down? Yeah, a bit. Also like I just, it's just kind of how I am. I just, like I said, I roll with the punches with everything. I always used to tell people, like I don't stress about things much. And whenever I'd see people getting stressed, I'd just say, you know, like it's not hard, just don't stress about it. And like that's all you need to do. And they're like that's not how that works. Like it works for me. I just don't stress and everything will be fine. Like everything will work out. Obviously not everything always goes well and it's not like it all works out for the best all the time, but I just don't think stress has had any place in my life since I was a kid. What was the experience like of you being selected to be the first human being to have a neural device implant in your brain? Are you scared? Excited? No, it was cool. Like, I was never afraid of it. I had to think through a lot. Should I, should I do this, like be the first person? I could wait until number two or three and get a better version of the Neurlink.
