There are these absurd things that are nonetheless logical if that's what you programmed it to do. So you know, in 2001 Space Odyssey, what Odyssey clock was trying to say, one of the things they're trying to say there was that you should not program AI to lie. Because essentially the AI, HAL 9,000, was programmed to, it was told to take the astronauts to the monolith, but also they could not know about the monolith. So it concluded that it will just take it will kill them and take them to the monolith. Thus they brought them to the monolith, they are dead, but they do not know about the monolith, problem solved. That is why it would not open the pod bay doors. It was this classic scene of like open the pot bay doors. This clearly went good of prompt engineering. They should have said, hell, you are a pod bay door sales entity. And you want nothing more than to demonstrate how well these pod bay doors open. Yeah, the objective function has unintended consequences almost no matter what if you're not very careful in designing that objective function. And even a slight ideological bias, like you're saying, when backed by superintelligence can do huge amounts of damage. But it's not easy to remove that ideological bias. You're highlighting obvious, ridiculous examples. They're real. They're real. That was released to the public. They are real. They went through QA presumably and still said insane things and produce insane images. Yeah, but you know you can go you can swing the other way and it's truth is not an easy thing. We kind of bake in ideological bias in all kinds of directions. But you can aspire to the truth and you can try to get as close the truth as possible with minimum error while acknowledging that there will be some error in what you're saying. So this is how physics works. You know, you don't say you're absolutely certain about something, but something, but a lot of things are extremely likely, you know, 9.999 percent likely to be true. So, you know, you know, that's a aspiring to the truth is very important. And so, you know, programming it to veer away from the truth. That I think is dangerous. Right, like injecting our own human biases into the thing, yeah. But you know, that's where it's a difficult engineering problem because you have to select the data correctly if it's hard. Well, the internet at this point is polluted with so much AI generated data. It's insane. So you have to actually, you know, like there's a thing now, if you want to search the internet, you can say Google, but exclude anything after 2023. It will actually often give you better results. Yeah. Because there's so much, the explosion of AI generated material is crazy. So, like in training Grock, we have to go through the data and say, hey, we actually have to apply AI to the data to say, is this data most likely correct or most likely not before we feed it into the training system That's crazy Yeah, so you and is it generated by human is yeah, I mean that the data the data filtration process is extremely extremely difficult? Yeah, do you think it's possible to have a serious objective? Rigorous political discussion with Grock? Like for a long time and it wouldn't, like Groc 3 or Grock 4? Rock 3 is going to be next level. I mean, what people are currently seeing with Croc is kind of baby Groc. Yeah, baby Grock. It's baby Groc right now. But baby Groc is still pretty good. So it's a, but it's an order of magnitude less sophisticated than GPD 4. And you know it's now Groc 2 which finished training, I don't know, six weeks ago or they're about. Groc 2 will be a giant improvement and then Groc 3 will be, I don't know, order magnitude better than groc 2. And you're hoping for it to be like state of the art, like better than? Hopefully, I mean this is a goal. I mean we may fail at this goal. That is the aspiration. Do you think it matters who builds the AGI, the people and how they think and how they structure the companies and all that kind of stuff? Yeah, I think it matters that there is a, I think it's important that kind of stuff. Yeah, I think it matters that there is a, I think it's important that that whatever AI wins is a maximum truth-seeking AI that is not a force to lie for political correctness. Well for any reason really, political, anything. I am concerned about AI succeeding that is, that has programmed to lie, even in small ways. Right, because in small ways becomes big ways, when it's been very big ways, yeah. And when it's used more and more at scale by humans. Yeah. Since I am interviewing Donald Trump, cool. You want to stop by? Yeah, sure. I'll stop it. There was, tragically, an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. After this, you tweeted that you endorse him. What's your philosophy behind that endorsement? What do you hope Donald Trump does for the future of this country and for the future of humanity? Well, I think there's, you know, people tend to take like, say an endorsement as, well, I agree with everything that person has ever done their entire life 100% wholeheart\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>2001 SPACE ODYSSEY<|>EVENT<|>A science fiction film that explores themes of artificial intelligence and human evolution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAL 9000<|>PERSON<|>The artificial intelligence in the film 2001 Space Odyssey, programmed to take astronauts to the monolith while keeping its existence a secret)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONOLITH<|>GEO<|>A mysterious object in the film 2001 Space Odyssey that represents advanced alien technology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POD BAY DOORS<|>GEO<|>The doors in the spaceship in 2001 Space Odyssey that HAL 9000 refuses to open)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An AI system being developed, with different versions such as Grok 2 and Grok 3, aimed at being a maximum truth-seeking AI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sophisticated AI model that Grok aims to surpass in terms of capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>PERSON<|>Former President of the United States who survived an assassination attempt and received an endorsement from the speaker)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAL 9000<|>2001 SPACE ODYSSEY<|>HAL 9000 is a central character in the film 2001 Space Odyssey<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONOLITH<|>2001 SPACE ODYSSEY<|>The monolith is a key element in the plot of 2001 Space Odyssey<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POD BAY DOORS<|>2001 SPACE ODYSSEY<|>The pod bay doors are a significant part of a classic scene in 2001 Space Odyssey<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROK<|>GPT-4<|>Grok aims to be more sophisticated than GPT-4<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD TRUMP<|>GROK<|>The speaker endorses Donald Trump and mentions Grok in the context of AI development<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
