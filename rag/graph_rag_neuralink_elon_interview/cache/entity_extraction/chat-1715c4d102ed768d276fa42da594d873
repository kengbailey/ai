So one of the reasons I think I struggle with that game is I'm such a keyboard person. So everything is done with your keyboard. If I can avoid touching the mouse, it's great. So how can you explain your high performance? I have like a whole ritual I go through. I play web grid. It's actually like a diet plan associated with this, like this whole thing. The first thing. So, the first thing is- I have to fast for five days, I have to go up to the mountains. Actually, it's kind, I mean, the fastening thing is important. So this is like, you know. Focuses the mind, yeah. Yeah, it's true. So what I do is I actually don't eat for a little, And then it has to be really late at night. This is again a night owl thing I think we share, but it has to be like, you know, midnight, 2 a.m. kind of time window. And I have a very specific like physical position I'll sit in, which is, I used to be, I was homeschooled growing up. And so I did most of my work like, and so I did most you have to make sure like there's not a lot of weight on your elbow you're playing so you can move quickly and that turn the gain of the cursor so the speed of the cursor way way up so it's like small motions that actually move the cursor. Are you moving with your wrist or you're never moving my fingers so I my wrist is almost completely still I'm just moving my the which I've been meaning to go down this rabbit hole of people that set the world record in Tetris. Those folks they're playing there's a there's a way to do this? Did you see this? I see the three like all the fingers are moving? Yeah, you could you could find a way to do it where like it's using a loophole like a bug that you can do some incredibly fast. So it's along that line, but not quite. But you do realize there will be like a few programmers right now listening to this cool, fast and eat peanut butter. Yeah, please, please try my record. I mean, the reason I did this, literally was just because I wanted the bar. Literally was just because I wanted the bar, literally was just because I wanted to, the number that we aim for it should not be like the minimum bar. What do you think is possible? Like 20? Yeah, I don't know what the limits, I mean the limits, you can calculate just in terms of like screen refresh rate and like cursor immediately jumping to the next target. But there's, I mean, I'm sure there's limits before that with just sort of reaction time and visual perception and things like that right there I never be thinking about. It also matters like how difficult the task is. You can imagine like some people might be able to do like 10,000 targets on the screen and maybe they can do better that way. So there's some like task optimizations you could do to try to boost your performance as well. What do you think it takes for Nolan to be able to do. You said like every increase in the number might require different, yeah, different improvements in the system. Yeah, I think the nature of this work is, I mean, the first answer that's important to say is I don't know. This is, you know, edge of the research. So again, nobody's gotten to that number before. So what's next is going to be a heuristic guess, from my part. What we've seen historically is that different parts of the stack would come bottlenecks at different time points. So, you know, when I first joined Ehrlich three years ago or so, one of the major problems was just the latency of the Bluetooth connection. It was just like the radio device wasn't super good, it was an earlier vision of the implant. And it just like no matter how good you are, was if your thing is updating every 30 milliseconds or 50 milliseconds, it's just going to be choppy. And no matter how good you are, that's going to be frustrating and lead to challenges. So, you know, at that point it was very clear that the main challenges just get the data off the device in a very reliable way such that you can enable the modeling challenge of how do you just build a good mapping, like the supervised learning problem of you have a bunch of data and you have a label you're trying to predict, just what is the right like neural decoder architecture and hyper parameters to optimize that. That was a problem for a bit. And once you solve that, actually just sort of software stability and reliability. You know, if you have widely varying sort of inference latency in your system or your, you know, your app just lags out every once in a while, it decreases your ability to maintain and get in a state of flow and it basically just disrupts your control experience. And so there's a variety different software bugs and improvements we made that basically increased the performance of the system, made it much more reliable, much more stable, and led to a state where we could reliably collect data to build better models with. So that was a bottleneck for a while. It's just sort of like the software stack itself. If I were to guess right now, there's sort of two major directions you could think about for improving BPS further. The first major direction is labeling. So labeling is again this fundamental challenge of given a window of time where the user is expressing some behavioral intent, what are they really trying to do at the granularity of every millisecond. And that again is a task design problem, it\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
