It was cool to see that their technology worked and that everything that they'd worked so hard for was like going to pay off. But I hadn't like moved a cursor or anything at that point. I had like interacted with a computer or anything at that point. So it, it just made sense. It was cool. I didn't really know much about BCI at that point either. So I didn't know what sort of step this was actually making. I didn't know if this was like a huge deal or if this was just like, okay, this is, you know, it's cool that we got this far, but we're actually hoping for something like much better down the road. It's like, okay, I just thought that they knew that it turned on. So it was like, cool. Like, this is, this is cool. What did you like read up on the specs of the hardware you get installed, like the number of threads? Yeah, yeah, I knew all of that, but it's all Greek to me. I was like, threads, 16 electrodes, 1,024 channels. Okay. Like that, that math checks out. Sounds right. Yeah. What was the first time you were able to move a mouse cursor? I know it must have been within the first maybe week, a week or two weeks that I was able to like first move the cursor. And again, like, it kind of made sense to me like it it didn't seem like that big of a deal Like it it was like okay. Well, how do I explain this? When everyone around you starts clapping for something that you've done, it's it's easy to say okay, like I did something cool. Like that was impressive in some way. What exactly that meant what it was hadn't really like set in for me. So again, I knew that me trying to move a body part and then that being mapped in some sort of like machine learning algorithm to be able to identify like my brain signals and then take that and give me cursory control. That all kind of made sense to me. I don't know like all the ins and outs of it, but I was like there are still signals in my brain firing. They just can't get through because there's like a gap in my spinal cord. And so they just, they can't get all the way down and back up, but they're still there. So when I moved the cursor for the first time, I was like, that's cool, but I expected that that should happen. Like it made sense to me. When I moved the cursor for the first time with just my mind without like physically trying to move, so I guess I can get into that just a little bit like the difference between attempted movement and imagined movement. Yeah, that's a fascinating difference. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So like attempted movement is me physically trying to attempt to move, say, my hand. I try to attempt to move my hand to the right, to the left, forward and back. And that's all attempted, attempt to, you know, like lift my finger up and down, attempt to kick or something. I'm physically trying to do all of those things even if you can't see it. Like I'm, this would be like me attempting to like shrug my shoulders or something. That's all attempted movement. That all, that's what I was doing for the first couple of weeks when they were going to give me cursor control. When I was doing body mapping, it was attempt to do this, attempt to do that. When Nier was telling me to imagine doing it, it like kind of made sense to me, but it's not something that people practice. Like if you started school as a child and they said, okay, write your name with this pencil, and so you do that, like, okay, now imagine writing your name with that pencil. Kids would think, like, I guess, like that kind of makes sense, and they would do it, but that's not something we're taught. It's all like how to do things physically. We think about like thought experiments and things, but that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not, that's not, that's not, that's not, that's not, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, okay, okay, okay, thi, okay, okay, thi, okay, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, thi, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like, that's not like,  it's all like how to do things physically. We think about like thought experiments and things, but that's not like that's not like a physical action of doing things, it's more like what you would do in certain situations. So imagine movement, it never really connected with me. Like I guess you could maybe describe it as like a professional athlete, like swinging a baseball bat or swinging like a golf club, like imagine what you're supposed to do.
