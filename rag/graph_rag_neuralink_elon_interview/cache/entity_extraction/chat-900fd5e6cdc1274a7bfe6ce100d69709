Like you try to name an example of something in your body that isn't directly controlled or massively influenced by the brain. And it's pretty hard. I mean, you might say like bone healing or something, but even those systems, the hypothalamus and pituitary end up playing a role in coordinating the endocrine system that does have a direct influence on, say, the calcium level in your blood that goes to bone healing. So non-obvious connections between those things implicate the brain as really a potent prime mover in all of health. One of the things I realized in the other direction too how most of the systems in the body integrated with a human brain. They affect the brain also, like the immune system. I think there's just, you know, people who study Alzheimer's and those kinds of things. It's just surprising how much you can understand of that from the immune system, from the other systems that don't obviously seem to have to anything to do with sort of the nervous system. They all play together. Yeah, you could understand how that would be driven by evolution too, just in some simple examples. If you get sick, if you get a communicable disease, you get the flu. It's pretty advantageous for your immune system to tell your brain, hey, now be antisocial for a few days. Don't go be the life of the party tonight. In fact, maybe just cuddle up somewhere warm under a blanket and just stay there for a day or two. And sure enough, that tends to be the behavior that you see both in animals and in humans. If you get sick, elevated levels of interlucans in your blood and TNF alpha in your blood, ask the brain to cut back on social activity and even moving around. You have lower locomotor activity in animals that are infected with viruses. So from there, the early days in neuroscience to surgery, when did that step happen? This is a leap. You know, it was sort of an evolution of thought. I wanted to study the brain. I started studying the brain in undergrad in this neuroimmunology lab. I, from there, realized at some point that I didn't want to just generate knowledge. I wanted to affect real changes in the actual world, in actual people's lives. And so, after having not really thought about going into medical school, I was on a track to go into a PhD program. I said, well, I'd like that option. I'd like to actually potentially help tangible people in front of me. And doing a little digging found that there exists these MD PhD programs where you can choose not to choose between them and do both. And so I went to USC for medical school and had a joint PhD program with Caltech where I met, actually chose that program particularly because of a researcher at Caltech named Richard Anderson, who's one of the godfathers of primate neuroscience, has a macaque lab where Utah rays and other electrodes were being inserted into the brains of monkeys to try to understand how intentions were being encoded in the brain. So, you know, I ended up there with the idea that maybe I would be a neurologist and study the brain on the side and then discovered that neurology, again I'm gonna make enemies by saying this, but neurology predominantly and distressingly to me is, is the practice of diagnosing a thing and then saying good luck with that when there's not much we can do. And neurosurgery very differently is a it's a powerful lever on taking people that are headed in a bad direction and changing their course in the sense of brain tumors that are potentially treatable or curable with surgery. You know, even aneurysms in the brain, blood vessels that are going to rupture, you can save lives really is at the end of the day what mattered to me. And so I was at USC, as I mentioned, that happens to be one of the great neurosurgery programs. And so I met these truly epic neurosurgeons, Alex Kolesi and Mike Apuzo and Steve Gianata and Marty Weiss, these sort of epic people that were just human beings in front of me. And so it kind of changed my thinking from neurosurgeons are distant gods that live on another planet and occasionally come and visit us to, these are humans that have problems and are people and there's nothing fundamentally preventing me from being one of them. And so, at the last minute in medical school I changed gears from going into a different specialty and switched into neurosurgery, which cost me a year. I had to do another year of research because I was so far along in the process that to switch into neurosurgery, the deadlines had already passed. So it was a decision that cost time, but absolutely worth it. What was the hardest part of the training on the neurosurgeon track? Yeah. Two things, I think, that, you know, residency in neurosurgery is sort of a competition of pain, of like how much pain can you eat and smile? Yeah. And so there's work hour restrictions that are not really, they're viewed at, I think, internally among the residents as weakness. And so most neurosurgery residents try to work as hard as they can, and that I think necessarily means working long hours and sometimes over the work hour limits. And you know we care about being compliant with whatever regulations are in front of us but I think more important than that people want to give all give their all in becoming a better neurosurgeon because the stakes are so high and so it's a real fight to get residents to say go home at the end of the the stakes are so high and so it's a real fight to get residents to say go home at the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
