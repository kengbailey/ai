Now for humanoid robots, the utility is much greater. So my guess is humanoid robots are more like at a billion plus per year. But you know, until you came along and started building Optimus, it was thought to be an extremely difficult problem. I mean, still it is extremely difficult. Yes, so walk in the park. I mean, Optimus currently would struggle to have what to walk in the park. I mean, it can walk in a park, it's not too difficult, but it will be able to walk over a wide range of terrain. Yeah, and pick up objects? Yeah, yeah. It can already do that. But like all kinds of objects. All foreign objects. I mean, pouring water in a cup, it's not true. Because then if you don't know anything about the container, it could be all kinds of containers. Yeah, there's going to be an immense amount of engineering just going into the hand. The hand might be, it might be close to half of all the engineering in the, in Optimus. From an electro-mechanical standpoint, the hand is probably roughly half of the engineering. But so much of the intelligence, so much the intelligence of humans goes into what we do with our hands. Yeah. Is the manipulation of the world, manipulation of objects in the world. Intelligence, safe manipulation of objects in the world, yeah. Yeah. I mean, you start really thinking about your hand and how it works. You know? I do all the time. The sensory control of homiculous is we have humongous hands. I mean, like your hands, the actuators, the muscles of your hand are almost overwhelmingly in your forearm. So your forearm has the muscles that actually control your hand. There's a few small muscles in the hand itself. But your hand is really like a skeleton meat puppet and with cables. So the muscles that control your fingers are in your forearm. And they go through the carpal ttunnel which is that you've got a little collection of bones and in a tiny tunnel that the that these cables the tendons go through and those tendons are what mostly what moves your hands and something like those tendons has to be engineered into the optimist in there to do all that kind stuff. Yeah, so like the current optimist, we try putting the actuators in the hand itself. Then you sort of end up having these like giant hands? Yeah, giant hands that look weird. And then they don't actually have enough degrees of freedom and or enough strength. So then you realize, okay, that's why you gotta put the actuators in the forearm. And just like a human, you gotta run cables through a narrow tunnel to operate the fingers. And then there's also a reason for not having all the fingers the same length. So it wouldn't be expensive from an energy or evolutionary standpoint to have all your fingers be the same length. Yeah, why not? Because it's actually better to have different lengths. Your dexterity is better if you've got fingers of different length. You're, you have, there are more things you can do, and your dexterity is actually better if your fingers are of different length. Like, there's a reason we've got a little finger this bigger? Yeah. Because it allows you to do, it helps you with fine motor skills. That, this little finger helps? It does. Hmm. If you lost your little finger, it would, you have noticeably less dexterity. So as you're figuring out this problem, you have to also figure out a way to do it so you can mass manufacture. It's to be as simple as possible. It's actually going to be quite complicated. The as possible part is it's quite a high bar. If you want to have a humanoid robot that can do things that a human can do, it's actually it's a very high bar. So our new arm has 22 degrees of freedom instead of 11 and has the like so the actuators in the forearm. And these all the actuators are designed from scratch, the physics first principles, the sensors are well designed from scratch. And we'll continue to put a tremendous amount of engineering effort into improving the hand. Like the hand, by hand I mean like the entire forearm from elbow forward is really the hand. So that's incredibly difficult engineering actually. And so the simplest possible version of a human or a robot that can do, even most, perhaps not all, of what a human can do is actually still very complicated. It's not it's not simple. It's very difficult. Can you just speak to what it takes for a great engineering team for you that what I saw in Memphis the super computer cluster is just this intense drive towards simplifying the process, understanding the process, constantly improving it, constantly iterating it. Well, it's easy to say, simplify it. It's very difficult to do it. You know, I have this very basic first principles algorithm that I run kind of as like a mantra, which is to first question the requirements, make the requirements less dumb. The requirements are always dumb to some degree. So if you want to sort off by reducing the number of requirements, and no matter how smart the person is who gave you those requirements, they're still done to some degree. If you have to start there, because otherwise you could get the perfect answer to the wrong question. So, try to make the question the least wrong possible. That's what question the requirements means. And then the second thing is try to delete the, whatever the step is, the part or the process step.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
