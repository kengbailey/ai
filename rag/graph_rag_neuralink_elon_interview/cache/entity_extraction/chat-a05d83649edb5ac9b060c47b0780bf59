I don't think that's necessary. It's just a, you know, a very useful and gratifying way of feeling your brain work. And as we said, it's one heck of a brain. Yeah. Everything we see around us, everything we love, everything that's beautiful, it's came from brains like these. It's all electrical activity happening inside your skull. And I for one am grateful that there's people like you that are exploring all the ways that it works and all the ways it can be made better. Thank you so much for talking today. It's been a joy. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matthew McDougal. And now, dear friends, here's Bliss Chapman, brain interface software lead at Neuralink. You told me that you've met hundreds of people with spinal cord injuries or with ALS, and that your motivation for helping at Neuralink is grounded and wanting to help them. Can you describe this motivation? Yeah. First, just a thank you to all the people I've got a chance to speak with for sharing their stories their stories with me. I don't think there's any world really in which I can share their stories as powerful a way as they can. But just I think to summarize at a very high level what I hear over and over again is that people with ALS or severe spina cord injury in a place where they basically can't move physically anymore, really at the end of the day are looking for independence and that can mean different things for different people. For some folks it can mean the ability just to be able to communicate again independently without needing to wear something on their face, without needing a caretaker to be able to put something in their mouth. For some folks can mean independence to be able to work again. To be able to navigate a computer digitally, to be able to get a job, to be able to support them their their their their their their their their their their their.. their. to support to support to support to support to support to support to support ultimately be able to support themselves after their family, maybe isn't there anymore to take care of them. And for some folks it's as simple as just being able to respond to their kid in time before they run away or get interested in something else. And these are deeply personal and sort of very human problems. And what strikes me again and again when talking with these folks is that this is actually an engineering problem. This is a problem that with the right resources, the right team, we can make a lot of progress on. And at the end of the day I think that's a deeply inspiring message and something that makes me excited to get up every day. So it's both an engineering problem in terms of a BCI, for example, that can give them capabilities where they can interact with the world, but also on the other side, it's an engineering problem for the rest of the world to make it more accessible for people living with quadriplegia. Yeah, and actually, I'll take a broad view sort of working in this problem space. So beyond PCI. I'm happy and excited and willing to support any way I can folks working on eye tracking systems, working on speech to tech systems, working on head trackers or mouth sticks or quad sticks. I haven't met many engineers and folks in the community that do exactly those things. And I think for the people who are trying to help, it doesn't matter what the complexity of the solution is as long as the problem is solved. And I want to emphasize that there can be many solutions out there that can help with these problems, and BCI is one of a collection of such solutions. So BCI in particular, I think offer several advantages here, and I think the folks that recognize this immediately are usually the people who have spinochord injury or some form of paralysis. Usually you don't have to explain to them why this might be something that could be helpful. It's usually pretty self-evident. But for the rest of us, folks that don't live with severe spondocourt injury or who don't know somebody with ALS, it's not often obvious why you would want a brain implant to be able to connect and navigate athat I've learned a huge amount just working with Nolan in the first Nureland clinical trial and understanding from him in his words why this device is impactful for him. And it's a nuanced topic. It can be the case that even if you can achieve the same thing, for example, with a mouse stick when navigating computer, he doesn't have access to that mouse stick every single minute of the day. He only has access when someone is available to to  front of him. And so a BCI can really offer a level of independence and autonomy that if it wasn't literally physically part of your body, it would be hard to achieve in any other way. So there's a lot of fascinating aspects to what it takes to get known to be able to control a cursor on the screen with his mind. You texted me, something that I just love. He said, I was part of the team that interviewed and selected P1. I was in the operating room during the first human surgery monitoring live signals coming out of the brain. I work with the user basically every day to develop new UX paradigms, decoding strategies. And I was part of the team that figured out how to recover useful BCI to new world record levels when the signal quality degraded. We'll talk about I think every aspect of that, but just zooming out, what was it like to be part of that, part of that team and part of that historic, I would say, historic first\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
