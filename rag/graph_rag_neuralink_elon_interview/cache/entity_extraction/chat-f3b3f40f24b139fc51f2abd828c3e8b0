So we're telling ourselves and fooling ourselves that there's some interesting meaning here. But I mean, I certainly think that BCI, and really, PCI at the end of the day, is a set of tools that help you kind of study the underlying mechanisms in a both like local but also broader sense. And whether, you know, there's some interesting patterns of like electrical signal that means like you're thinking this versus and you can either like learn from like many, many sets of data to correlate some of that and be able to do mind reading or not, I'm not sure. I certainly would not kind of blow that out as a possibility, but I think BCI alone probably can't do that. There's probably additional set of tools and framework and also just hard problem of consciousness at the end of the day is rooted in this philosophical question of like, what is the meaning of it all? It's the nature of our existence. Like where's the mind emerged from this complex network? Like, yeah, how does the, uh, how does the subjective experience emerge from just a bunch of spikes, electrical spikes? Yeah, yeah, I mean, we do really think about BCI and what we're building as a tool for understanding the mind, the brain, the only question that matters. There's actually, there actually is some biological existence proof of what it would take to kind of start to form some of these experiences that may be unique. If you actually look at every one of our brains, there are two hemispheres. There's a left-sided brain, there's a right-sided brain. And I mean, unless you have some other conditions, you normally don't feel like left lex or right. Like you just feel like left lex or right legs. You just feel like one legs, right? So what is happening there? If you actually look at the two hemispheres, there's a structure that kind of connectorize the two, called the corpus colossum, that is supposed to have around 200 to 300 million connections or axons. So whether that means that's the number of interface and electrodes that we need to create some sort of mind meld or from that, like whatever new conscious experience that you can experience. But yeah, I do think that there's like kind of an interesting existence proof that we all have. And that threshold is unknown at this time. Oh yeah, these things, everything in this domain is you know speculation, right? And then there will be, uh, you'd be continuously pleasantly surprised. Do you see a world where there's millions of people, like tens of millions, hundreds of millions, the people walking around with the neural device, or multiple neural devices in their brain? I do. First of all, there are, like if you look at worldwide, people suffering from movement disorders and visual deficits, I mean that's in the tens if not hundreds of millions of people. So that alone I think there's a lot of benefit and potential good that we can do with this type of technology. And once you start to get into kind of technology. And when you start to get into kind of neuro like psychiatric application, you know, depression, anxiety, hunger, or you know obesity, like mood, control of appetite, I mean that starts to become, you know, very real to everyone. Not to mention that every, most people on earth have a smartphone. And once BCI starts competing with a smartphone as a preferred methodology of interacting with the digital world, that also becomes an interesting thing. Oh yeah, I mean, that, yeah, this is even before going to that, right? I mean there's like almost, I mean the entire world that could benefit from these types of thing. And then, yeah, like if we're talking about kind of next generation of how we interface with, you know, machines or even ourselves, in many ways I think BCI can play a role in that. And you know some of the things that I also talk about is I do think that there is a real possibility that you could see you know, eight billion people walking around with Neurlink. Well, thank you so much for pushing ahead and I look forward to that exciting future. Thanks for having me. Thanks for listening to this conversation with DJ Saw. And now dear friends, here's Matthew McDougal, the head neurosurgeon at Neurlink. When did you first become fascinated with the human brain? Since forever, as far back as I can remember, I've been interested in the human brain. I mean, I was, you know, a thoughtful kid and a bit of an outsider, and you, you know, sit there thinking about what the most important things in the world are in your in your little tiny adolescent brain, and the answer that I came to, that I converged on, was that all of the things you can possibly conceive of as things that are important for human beings to care about are literally contained in the skull. Both the perception of them and their relative values, and the solutions to all our problems and all of our problems are all contained in the perception of them and their relative values and the solutions to all our problems and all of our problems are all contained in the skull. And if we knew more about how that worked, how the brain encodes information and generates desires and generates agony and suffering, we could do more about it. You know, you think about all the really great triumphs in human history, you think about all the really horrific tragedies, you know, you think about the Holocaust, you think about any prison full of human stories, and all of those problems boil down to neurochemistry. So if you get a little bit of control over that, you provide people the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
