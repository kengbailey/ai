It's really, really really well done. And so, yeah, there's that bias that there's a cursor drift that Nolan talked about in a stream. Although he said that you guys were just playing around with it with him and they're constantly improving, so that could have been just a snapshot of that particular moment a particular day, but he said that there was this cursor drift and this bias that could be removed by him, I guess, looking to the right side of the screen, to kind of adjust the bias. Yeah, yeah. That's one interface action I guess, looking to the right side of the screen, to the left side of the screen to kind of adjust the bias. Yeah, yeah. That's one interface action, I guess, to adjust the bias. Yeah. So this is actually an idea that comes out of academia. There is some prior work with sort of braingate clinical chart participants, where they user can essentially flash the cursor over to the side of the screen and it opens up a window where they can actually sort of adjust or tune exactly the bias of the cursor. So bias maybe for people who aren't familiar is just sort of what is the default motion of the cursor if you're imagining nothing. And it turns out that that's one of the first sort of qualia of the cursor control experience that's impacted by neural non-stationarity. Quality of the cursor experience. I mean, I don't know how else to describe it. Like, you know, I'm not the guy moving. It's very poetic. I love it. The quality of the cursor experience. Yeah, I mean, it is a joyful, a really pleasant experience. And when it doesn't work well, it's a very frustrating experience. That's actually the art of UX. It's like, you have the possibility to frustrate people or the possibility to give them joy. And at the end of the day, it really is truly the case that UX is how the thing works. And so it's not just like what's showing on the screen. It's also, you know, what control surfaces does a decoder provide the user? We want them to feel like they're in the F1 car, not like the, you know, some like, mnine van. And that really truly is really is truly the F1 driver. And there's different, you know, control surfaces that different kinds of cars and airplanes provide the user. And we take a lot of inspiration from that when designing how the cursor should behave. And what maybe one nuance of this is, you know, even details, the mouse, you know, even details like when you move a mouse, the sort of response curve, the track pad translates to cursor movement is different than how it works with a mouse. When you move on the track pad there's a different response function, different curve to how much a movement translates to input to the computer than when you do it physically with the mouse. And that's because somebody sat down a long time ago when they're designed the initial input systems to any these different systems. And now we're designing sort of the next generation of this input system to a computer which is entirely done via the brain and there's no appropriate receptive feedback. Again you don't feel the mouse in your hand, you don't feel the keys under your fingertips, and you want a control surface that still makes it easy and intuitive for the user to understand the state of the system and how that that UX is completely, it fades into the background to become something that's so natural and intuitive that it's subconscious to the user. And they just should feel like they have basically direct control over the cursor. It just does what they want it to do. They're not thinking about the implementation of how to make it do what they want it to do. It's just doing what izes your chance to hit the target. I don't even know what I'm asking but I'm hoping the intention of my question will land on a profound answer. No, is there some kind of understanding of the laws of UX when it comes to the context of somebody using their brain to control it? Like that's different than actual with a mouse. I think we're in the early stages of discovering those laws, so I wouldn't claim to have solved that problem yet, but there's definitely some things we've learned that make it easier for the user to get stuff done. And it's pretty straightforward when you verbalize it, but it takes a while to actually get to that point when you're in the process of debugging the stuff in the trenches. One of those things is that any machine learning system you build has some number of errors. And it matters how those errors translate to the downstream user experience. For example, if you're developing a search algorithm in your photos, if you search for, you know, your friend Joe and it pulls up a photo of your friend Josephine, maybe that's not a big deal, because the cost of an error is not that high. In a different scenario where you're trying to, you know, detect insurance fraud or something like this and you're directly sending someone to court because of some machine learning model output, then the errors make a lot more sense to be careful about. You want to be very thoughtful about how those errors translate to downstream effects. The same is the stream BCI. So, for example, if you're building a model that's decoding a velocity the left click, for example. These have sort of different tradeoffs of how precise you need to be before it becomes useful to the end user. For velocity, it's okay to be on average correct because the output of the model is integrated through time. So if the user's trying to click at position A and they're currently in the output of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NOLAN<|>PERSON<|>Nolan is a person who discussed cursor drift and bias in a stream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAINGATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Braingate is involved in clinical trials related to neural interfaces and cursor control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F1<|>EVENT<|>F1 refers to Formula 1, a high-speed car racing event, used metaphorically to describe the desired user experience)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UX stands for User Experience, which is the field focused on the overall experience of users interacting with a product)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOE<|>PERSON<|>Joe is a hypothetical friend used in an example about search algorithms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSEPHINE<|>PERSON<|>Josephine is a hypothetical friend used in an example about search algorithms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BCI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BCI stands for Brain-Computer Interface, a technology that allows direct communication between the brain and an external device)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOLAN<|>BRAINGATE<|>Nolan discussed cursor drift and bias, which is related to Braingate's work on neural interfaces<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UX<|>BCI<|>UX principles are applied to improve the user experience of BCI systems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOE<|>JOSEPHINE<|>Joe and Josephine are used in an example to illustrate search algorithm errors<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
